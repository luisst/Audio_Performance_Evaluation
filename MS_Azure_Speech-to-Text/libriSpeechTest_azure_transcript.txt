/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0157.wav	WHAT DID CHRISTIANITY DO FOR THEM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0158.wav	THEY HATED PLEASURE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0159.wav	THEY MUFFLED ALL THE BELLS OF GLADNESS

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0161.wav	THE PURITAN BELIEVED THE BIBLE TO BE THE WORD OF GOD AND THIS BELIEF HAS ALWAYS MADE THOSE WHO HELD IT CRUEL AND WRETCHED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0162.wav	LET ME REFER TO JUST ONE FACT SHOWING THE INFLUENCE OF A BELIEF IN THE BIBLE ON HUMAN BEINGS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0163.wav	THE QUEEN RECEIVED THE BIBLE KISSED IT AND PLEDGED HERSELF TO DILIGENTLY READ THEREIN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0164.wav	IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS JUST AS FIENDISH JUST AS INFAMOUS AS THE CATHOLIC SPIRIT

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0179.wav	IF THESE CORNER STONES ARE FACTS IT FOLLOWS AS A NECESSITY THAT MATTER AND FORCE ARE FROM AND TO ETERNITY THAT THEY CAN NEITHER BE INCREASED NOR DIMINISHED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0180.wav	IT FOLLOWS THAT NOTHING HAS BEEN OR CAN BE CREATED THAT THERE NEVER HAS BEEN OR CAN BE A CREATOR

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0231.wav	SURE HELD SO TIGHT WE COULD HARDLY GET IT OUT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0232.wav	MAYBE THE FIGHT WAS ABOUT WHO OWNED THE WATCH FOR THE DAGOS TALKED IN THEIR FOREIGN LINGO AND NONE OF THE NEIGHBORS COULD TELL WHAT THEY WERE SAYIN I SEE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0233.wav	AND THE WATCH HAVE YOU IT YES IT'S HERE

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0240.wav	BEFORE THE BIG WIND IN IRELAND SUGGESTED THONG WITH A NOD AT HIS IRISH COMPATRIOT SLIGHTLY LAUGHED THE COLONEL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0241.wav	THAT'S RIGHT AGREED THE COLONEL AS HE CONTINUED TO MOVE HIS MAGNIFYING GLASS OVER THE SURFACE OF THE STILL TICKING WATCH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0242.wav	AND A CLOSE OBSERVER MIGHT HAVE OBSERVED THAT HE DID NOT TOUCH HIS BARE FINGERS TO THE TIMEPIECE BUT POKED IT ABOUT AND TOUCHED IT HERE AND THERE WITH THE END OF A LEADPENCIL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0243.wav	AND DONOVAN TAKE A FRIEND'S ADVICE AND DON'T BE TOO FREE WITH THAT WATCH TOO FREE WITH IT

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0250.wav	I WANT TO TALK OVER DARCY'S CASE WITH YOU THE COLONEL HAD SAID AND THE TWO HAD TALKED HAD THOUGHT HAD TALKED AGAIN AND NOW WERE SILENT FOR A TIME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0251.wav	WHAT ARE THE CHANCES OF GETTING HIM OFF LEGALLY IF WE GO AT IT FROM A NEGATIVE STANDPOINT ASKED THE COLONEL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0252.wav	RATHER A HYPOTHETICAL QUESTION COLONEL BUT I SHOULD SAY IT MIGHT BE A FIFTY FIFTY PROPOSITION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0253.wav	AT BEST HE WOULD GET OFF WITH A SCOTCH VERDICT OF NOT PROVEN BUT HE DOESN'T WANT THAT NOR DO I
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0254.wav	AND YOU I DON'T WANT IT EITHER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0255.wav	BUT I WANT TO KNOW JUST WHERE WE STAND NOW I KNOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0256.wav	BUT I NEED TO DO A LITTLE MORE SMOKING OUT FIRST NOW I WANT TO THINK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0257.wav	IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME I'LL PRETEND I'M FISHING AND I MAY CATCH SOMETHING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0258.wav	IN FACT I HAVE A FEELING THAT I'LL LAND MY FISH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0259.wav	I'D RECOMMEND HIM TO YOU INSTEAD OF BLACKSTONE THANKS LAUGHED KENNETH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0260.wav	WHAT IS IT PERHAPS I CAN HELP YOU
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0261.wav	THE OLD ADAGE OF TWO HEADS YOU KNOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0262.wav	YES IT STILL HOLDS GOOD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0263.wav	NO ALIMONY REPEATED THE COLONEL PUZZLED YES JUST THAT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0264.wav	AND THERE'S NO REASON YOU SHOULDN'T KNOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0265.wav	CHUCKLED THE COLONEL AS HE SKILFULLY PLAYED THE LUCKLESS TROUT NOW STRUGGLING TO GET LOOSE FROM THE HOOK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0266.wav	AND WHEN THE FISH WAS LANDED PANTING ON THE GRASS AND SHAG HAD BEEN ROUSED FROM HIS SLUMBER TO SLIP THE NOW LIMP FISH INTO THE CREEL COLONEL ASHLEY GAVE A SIGH OF RELIEF AND REMARKED I THINK I SEE IT NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0267.wav	THE REASON SHE ASKED NO ALIMONY INQUIRED KENNETH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0268.wav	NO I WASN'T THINKING OF THAT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0269.wav	HOWEVER DON'T THINK I'M NOT INTERESTED IN YOUR CASE I'VE FISHED ENOUGH FOR TO DAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0270.wav	WELL I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU CAN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0271.wav	IT ISN'T GENERALLY KNOWN WENT ON THE LAWYER THAT THE HOTEL KEEPER'S WIFE HAS LEFT HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0272.wav	IT WAS ONE OF WHAT AT FIRST MIGHT BE CALLED REFINED CRUELTY ON HER HUSBAND'S PART DEGENERATING GRADUALLY INTO THAT OF THE BASER SORT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0273.wav	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT LARCH STRUCK HER THAT THERE WAS PHYSICAL ABUSE DO YOU ASKED THE COLONEL THAT'S WHAT HE DID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0274.wav	THE COLONEL DID NOT DISCLOSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS NO NEWS TO HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0275.wav	AARON GRAFTON'S STATEMENT WAS BEING UNEXPECTEDLY CONFIRMED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0276.wav	HE REMEMBERED THAT CYNTHIA AND GRAFTON HAD ONCE BEEN IN LOVE WITH EACH OTHER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0277.wav	SHE SAID HE HAD STRUCK HER MORE THAN ONCE AND SHE COULD STAND IT NO LONGER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0278.wav	BECAUSE LARCH MADE NO DEFENSE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0279.wav	LARCH BY REFUSING TO APPEAR PRACTICALLY ADMITTED THE CHARGES AGAINST HIM AND DID NOT OPPOSE THE SEPARATION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0280.wav	SO I HAD TO LET HER HAVE HER WAY AND WE DID NOT ASK THE COURT FOR MONEY THOUGH I HAD NO SUCH SQUEAMISH FEELINGS WHEN IT CAME TO MY COUNSEL FEE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0281.wav	NO BUT HE WILL OR I'LL SUE HIM AND GET JUDGMENT OH HE'LL PAY ALL RIGHT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0282.wav	AND IT TAKES ALL SORTS OF PERSONS TO MAKE IT UP
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0283.wav	STILL I WOULD LIKE TO KNOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0284.wav	THE MURDER OF MISSUS DARCY HAD SOME TIME AGO BEEN SHIFTED OFF THE FRONT PAGE THOUGH IT WOULD GET BACK THERE WHEN THE YOUNG JEWELER WAS TRIED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0285.wav	IT HAD A DOUBLE REPUTATION SO TO SPEAK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0286.wav	GRAVE AND EVEN REVEREND CONVENTIONS ASSEMBLED IN ITS BALLROOM AND POLITICIANS OF THE UPPER IF NOT BETTER CLASS WERE FREQUENTLY SEEN IN ITS DINING ROOM OR CAFE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0287.wav	LARCH HIMSELF WAS A PECULIAR CHARACTER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0288.wav	IN A SMALLER PLACE HE WOULD HAVE BEEN CALLED A SALOON KEEPER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0289.wav	AND IT WAS THIS MAN RICH IT WAS SAID HANDSOME CERTAINLY THAT CYNTHIA RATCHFORD HAD MARRIED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0290.wav	TO THIS WAS THE ANSWER WHISPERED MONEY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0291.wav	AND IN A WAY IT WAS TRUE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0292.wav	SHE ALSO SAW AN OPPORTUNITY OF PAYING OLD DEBTS AND REAPING SOME REVENGES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0293.wav	AFTER THE MARRIAGE WHICH WAS A BRILLIANT AND GAY ONE IF NOT HAPPY THE LARCH HOTEL IT COULD HARDLY BE CALLED A HOME BECAME THE SCENE OF MANY FESTIVE OCCASIONS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0294.wav	THEN IT WAS SAID OF LARCH THAT SOON AFTER THE ECHOES OF THE WEDDING CHIMES HAD DIED AWAY HE HAD BEGUN TO TREAT HIS WIFE WITH REFINED CRUELTY THAT HIDDEN AWAY FROM THE PUBLIC UNDERNEATH HIS HABITUAL MANNER THERE WAS THE RAWNESS OF THE BRUTE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0295.wav	BUT IT WAS NOTICED THAT THE OLDER AND MORE CONSERVATIVE FAMILIES WERE LESS OFTEN REPRESENTED AND WHEN THEY WERE IT WAS BY SOME OF THE YOUNGER MEMBERS WHOSE REPUTATIONS WERE ALREADY SMIRCHED OR WHO HAD NOT YET ACQUIRED ANY AND WERE WILLING TO TAKE A CHANCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0296.wav	IT WOULDN'T DO YOU KNOW AFTER THAT STORY CAME OUT FOR ME AND THE VICE CHANCELLOR WHO SAT IN THE CASE AS WELL AS OTHER JUDGES AND MEMBERS OF THE BAR TO BE SEEN THERE KENNETH EXPLAINED TO THE COLONEL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0297.wav	MEANWHILE COLONEL ASHLEY WAS A VERY BUSY MAN AND TO NO ONE DID HE TELL VERY MUCH ABOUT HIS ACTIVITIES HE SAW DARCY FREQUENTLY AT THE JAIL AND TO THAT YOUNG MAN'S PLEADINGS THAT SOMETHING BE DONE ALWAYS RETURNED THE ANSWER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0298.wav	DON'T WORRY IT WILL COME OUT ALL RIGHT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0299.wav	I'M GOING TO RECTIFY THEM BUT IT WILL TAKE TIME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0300.wav	IT'S HARD FOR MISS MASON TOO ALTHOUGH SHE'S BEARING UP LIKE A MAJOR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0301.wav	SO KING GOT BAIL WHO PUT IT UP
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0302.wav	IT WAS HIGH LARCH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0303.wav	THEY TOOK HARRY AWAY A WHILE AGO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0304.wav	BUT HIS ARE PRETTY UNCERTAIN SHOES TO BE IN JUST THE SAME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0305.wav	ONLY THAT I DARCY HESITATED AND GREW RED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0306.wav	GOOD EVENING COLONEL HE CALLED GENIALLY WILL YOU JOIN ME IN A WELSH RABBIT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0307.wav	THANK YOU NO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0308.wav	I'M AFRAID MY DIGESTION ISN'T QUITE UP TO THAT AS I'VE HAD TO CUT OUT MY FISHING OF LATE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0309.wav	NOW AS TO CERTAIN MATTERS IN THE STORE ON THE MORNING OF THE MURDER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0310.wav	THE STOPPED CLOCKS FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU ANY THEORY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0311.wav	THERE WERE THREE OF THEM THE CENTER FIGURE BEING THAT OF HARRY KING AND HE WAS VERY MUCH INTOXICATED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0312.wav	THAT IS NOT ALWAYS BUT SOMETIMES IT HAPPENED TO BE SO NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0313.wav	I BEG YOUR PARDON HE SAID IN THE CULTURED TONES HE KNEW SO WELL HOW TO USE YET OF WHICH HE MADE SO LITTLE USE OF LATE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0314.wav	I SAID WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN REMARKED THE OTHER WE'VE MISSED YOU
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0315.wav	I SAID I WAS GOLFING HE WENT ON EXCEEDINGLY DISTINCTLY THOUGH WITH AN EFFORT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0316.wav	WHY POLONIUS SOME ONE ASKED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0317.wav	BECAUSE DEAR FRIEND REPLIED KING SOFTLY HE SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A CERTAIN PERSON HERE WHO TALKS TOO MUCH BUT WHO IS NOT SO WISE AS HE THINKS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0318.wav	THERE WAS A RATTLE OF COINS ON THE MAHOGANY BAR AS KING SOUGHT TO DISENTANGLE A SINGLE BILL FROM THE WADDED UP CURRENCY IN HIS POCKET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0319.wav	IT'S IT'S AN ODD COIN AN OLD ROMAN ONE THAT MISSUS DARCY HAD IN HER PRIVATE COLLECTION KEPT IN THE JEWELRY STORE SAFE WAS THE WHISPERED ANSWER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0320.wav	I WENT OVER THEM THE OTHER DAY AND NOTICED SOME WERE MISSING THOUGH I SAW THEM ALL WHEN I PAID A VISIT TO HER JUST A SHORT TIME BEFORE SHE WAS KILLED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0321.wav	THAT WAS HERS WENT ON THE JEWELER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0322.wav	NOW HARRY KING HAS IT EXCLAIMED COLONEL ASHLEY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0323.wav	IT IS SIGNIFICANT TO NOTE IN THIS CONNECTION THAT THE NEW KING WAS AN UNSWERVING ADHERENT OF THE CULT OF ASHUR BY THE ADHERENTS OF WHICH HE WAS PROBABLY STRONGLY SUPPORTED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0324.wav	AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS REIGN THERE WAS MUCH SOCIAL DISCONTENT AND SUFFERING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0325.wav	WELL MIGHT SHARDURIS EXCLAIM IN THE WORDS OF THE PROPHET WHERE IS THE KING OF ARPAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0326.wav	TIGLATH PILESER HOWEVER CROSSED THE EUPHRATES AND MOVING NORTHWARD DELIVERED AN UNEXPECTED ATTACK ON THE URARTIAN ARMY IN QUMMUKH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0327.wav	A FIERCE BATTLE ENSUED AND ONE OF ITS DRAMATIC INCIDENTS WAS A SINGLE COMBAT BETWEEN THE RIVAL KINGS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0328.wav	AN ATTEMPT WAS MADE TO CAPTURE KING SHARDURIS WHO LEAPT FROM HIS CHARIOT AND MADE HASTY ESCAPE ON HORSEBACK HOTLY PURSUED IN THE GATHERING DARKNESS BY AN ASSYRIAN CONTINGENT OF CAVALRY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0329.wav	DESPITE THE BLOW DEALT AGAINST URARTU ASSYRIA DID NOT IMMEDIATELY REGAIN POSSESSION OF NORTH SYRIA
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/0330.wav	THE SHIFTY MATI ILU EITHER CHERISHED THE HOPE THAT SHARDURIS WOULD RECOVER STRENGTH AND AGAIN INVADE NORTH SYRIA OR THAT HE MIGHT HIMSELF ESTABLISH AN EMPIRE IN THAT REGION

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1371.wav	AT THE TIME OF THE GALLATIN BANK ROBBERY I WAS GATHERING CATTLE IN ELLIS COUNTY TEXAS CATTLE THAT I BOUGHT FROM PLEAS TAYLOR AND RECTOR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1372.wav	THIS CAN BE PROVED BY BOTH OF THEM ALSO BY SHERIFF BARKLEY AND FIFTY OTHER RESPECTABLE MEN OF THAT COUNTY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1373.wav	I BROUGHT THE CATTLE TO KANSAS THAT FALL AND REMAINED IN SAINT CLAIR COUNTY UNTIL FEBRUARY

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1389.wav	I HAD NOT HEARD OF THAT WHEN I WROTE THE LETTER OF EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR AND TO CORRECT ANY MISAPPREHENSION THAT MIGHT BE CREATED BY OMITTING IT I WILL SAY THAT AT THAT TIME I WAS AT NEOSHO KANSAS WITH A DROVE OF CATTLE WHICH I SOLD TO MAJOR RAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1390.wav	IT WAS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE ROCK ISLAND ROBBERY AT ADAIR IOWA THAT THERE FIRST APPEARED A DELIBERATE ENLISTMENT OF SOME LOCAL PAPERS IN MISSOURI TO CONNECT US WITH THIS ROBBERY

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1392.wav	FRIDAY WE MOVED TOWARD WATERVILLE AND FRIDAY NIGHT WE CAMPED BETWEEN ELYSIAN AND GERMAN LAKE

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1395.wav	FINALLY WE ADMINISTERED TO HIM AN OATH NOT TO BETRAY OUR WHEREABOUTS UNTIL WE HAD TIME TO MAKE OUR ESCAPE AND HE AGREED NOT TO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1396.wav	NO SOONER HOWEVER WAS HE RELEASED THAN HE MADE POSTHASTE INTO MANKATO TO ANNOUNCE OUR PRESENCE AND IN A FEW MINUTES ANOTHER POSSE WAS LOOKING FOR US
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1397.wav	THE WHISTLE ON THE OIL MILL BLEW AND WE FEARED THAT IT WAS A SIGNAL THAT HAD BEEN AGREED UPON TO ALARM THE TOWN IN CASE WE WERE OBSERVED BUT WE WERE NOT MOLESTED

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1403.wav	MAKE FOR THE HORSES I SAID EVERY MAN FOR HIMSELF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1404.wav	THERE IS NO USE STOPPING TO PICK UP A COMRADE HERE FOR WE CAN'T GET HIM THROUGH THE LINE JUST CHARGE THEM AND MAKE IT IF WE CAN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1405.wav	I GOT UP AS THE SIGNAL FOR THE CHARGE AND WE FIRED ONE VOLLEY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1406.wav	ONE OF THE FELLOWS IN THE OUTER LINE NOT BRAVE ENOUGH HIMSELF TO JOIN THE VOLUNTEERS WHO HAD COME IN TO BEAT US OUT WAS NOT DISPOSED TO BELIEVE IN THE SURRENDER AND HAD HIS GUN LEVELLED ON BOB IN SPITE OF THE HANDKERCHIEF WHICH WAS WAVING AS A FLAG OF TRUCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1407.wav	SHERIFF GLISPIN OF WATONWAN COUNTY WHO WAS TAKING BOB'S PISTOL FROM HIM WAS ALSO SHOUTING TO THE FELLOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1408.wav	INCLUDING THOSE RECEIVED IN AND ON THE WAY FROM NORTHFIELD I HAD ELEVEN WOUNDS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1409.wav	AND SHERIFF GLISPIN'S ORDER NOT TO SHOOT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE PROTECTORATE THAT MINNESOTA PEOPLE ESTABLISHED OVER US
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1410.wav	THESE HATREDS WERE SOON TO MAKE TROUBLE FOR ME OF WHICH I HAD NEVER DREAMED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1411.wav	HENRY WASHINGTON YOUNGER MY FATHER REPRESENTED JACKSON COUNTY THREE TIMES IN THE LEGISLATURE AND WAS ALSO JUDGE OF THE COUNTY COURT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1412.wav	MY MOTHER WHO WAS BURSHEBA FRISTOE OF INDEPENDENCE WAS THE DAUGHTER OF RICHARD FRISTOE WHO FOUGHT UNDER GENERAL ANDREW JACKSON AT NEW ORLEANS JACKSON COUNTY HAVING BEEN SO NAMED AT MY GRANDFATHER FRISTOE'S INSISTENCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1413.wav	I CANNOT REMEMBER WHEN I DID NOT KNOW HOW TO SHOOT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1414.wav	MY BROTHER JAMES WAS BORN JANUARY FIFTEENTH EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JOHN IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND ROBERT IN DECEMBER EIGHTEEN FIFTY THREE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1415.wav	MY ELDEST BROTHER RICHARD DIED IN EIGHTEEN SIXTY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1416.wav	MY FATHER WAS IN THE EMPLOY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AND HAD THE MAIL CONTRACT FOR FIVE HUNDRED MILES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1417.wav	HE HAD STARTED BACK TO HARRISONVILLE IN A BUGGY BUT WAS WAYLAID ONE MILE SOUTH OF WESTPORT A SUBURB OF KANSAS CITY AND BRUTALLY MURDERED FALLING OUT OF HIS BUGGY INTO THE ROAD WITH THREE MORTAL BULLET WOUNDS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1418.wav	MISSUS WASHINGTON WELLS AND HER SON SAMUEL ON THE ROAD HOME FROM KANSAS CITY TO LEE'S SUMMIT RECOGNIZED THE BODY AS THAT OF MY FATHER

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1420.wav	MISSUS MC CORKLE JUMPED FROM THE WINDOW OF THE HOUSE AND ESCAPED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1421.wav	AS THE RAIDERS LEFT ONE OF THEM SHOUTED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1422.wav	NOW OLD LADY CALL ON YOUR PROTECTORS WHY DON'T YOU CALL ON COLE YOUNGER NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1423.wav	EVERY KNOT REPRESENTED A HUMAN LIFE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1424.wav	BUT SHE FAILED TO FIND THE COMFORT SHE SOUGHT FOR ANNOYANCES CONTINUED IN A MORE AGGRAVATED FORM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1425.wav	TWO MONTHS AFTER THIS INCIDENT THE SAME PERSECUTORS AGAIN ENTERED OUR HOME IN THE DEAD OF THE NIGHT AND AT THE POINT OF A PISTOL TRIED TO FORCE MY MOTHER TO SET FIRE TO HER OWN HOME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1426.wav	I HAVE ALWAYS FELT THAT THE EXPOSURE TO WHICH SHE WAS SUBJECTED ON THIS CRUEL JOURNEY TOO HARD EVEN FOR A MAN TO TAKE WAS THE DIRECT CAUSE OF HER DEATH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1427.wav	FROM HARRISONVILLE SHE WENT TO WAVERLY WHERE SHE WAS HOUNDED CONTINUALLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1428.wav	ONE OF THE CONDITIONS UPON WHICH HER LIFE WAS SPARED WAS THAT SHE WOULD REPORT AT LEXINGTON WEEKLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1429.wav	ONE OF MY OLD SCHOOL TEACHERS WHOM I HAVE NEVER SEEN SINCE THE SPRING OR SUMMER OF EIGHTEEN SIXTY TWO IS STEPHEN B ELKINS SENATOR FROM WEST VIRGINIA
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1430.wav	WHEN I WAS TAKEN PRISONER I EXPECTED TO BE SHOT WITHOUT CEREMONY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1431.wav	I URGED ON THE BOYS THAT WHATEVER HAPPENED WE SHOULD NOT SHOOT ANY ONE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1432.wav	WHEN MILLER AND I CROSSED THE BRIDGE THE THREE WERE ON SOME DRY GOODS BOXES AT THE CORNER NEAR THE BANK AND AS SOON AS THEY SAW US WENT RIGHT INTO THE BANK INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR US TO GET THERE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1433.wav	WHEN WE CAME UP I TOLD MILLER TO SHUT THE BANK DOOR WHICH THEY HAD LEFT OPEN IN THEIR HURRY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1434.wav	J S ALLEN WHOSE HARDWARE STORE WAS NEAR TRIED TO GO INTO THE BANK BUT MILLER ORDERED HIM AWAY AND HE RAN AROUND THE CORNER SHOUTING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1435.wav	GET YOUR GUNS BOYS THEY'RE ROBBING THE BANK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1436.wav	AND I CALLED TO HIM TO GET INSIDE AT THE SAME TIME FIRING A PISTOL SHOT IN THE AIR AS A SIGNAL TO THE THREE BOYS AT THE BRIDGE THAT WE HAD BEEN DISCOVERED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1437.wav	ALMOST AT THIS INSTANT I HEARD A PISTOL SHOT IN THE BANK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1438.wav	CHADWELL WOODS AND JIM RODE UP AND JOINED US SHOUTING TO PEOPLE IN THE STREET TO GET INSIDE AND FIRING THEIR PISTOLS TO EMPHASIZE THEIR COMMANDS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1439.wav	IF ANY OF OUR PARTY SHOT HIM IT MUST HAVE BEEN WOODS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1440.wav	MEANTIME THE STREET WAS GETTING UNCOMFORTABLY HOT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1441.wav	EVERY TIME I SAW ANY ONE WITH A BEAD ON ME I WOULD DROP OFF MY HORSE AND TRY TO DRIVE THE SHOOTER INSIDE BUT I COULD NOT SEE IN EVERY DIRECTION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1442.wav	DOCTOR WHEELER WHO HAD GONE UPSTAIRS IN THE HOTEL SHOT MILLER AND HE LAY DYING IN THE STREET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1443.wav	CHANGING HIS PISTOL TO HIS LEFT HAND BOB RAN OUT AND MOUNTED MILLER'S MARE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1444.wav	WHAT KEPT YOU SO LONG I ASKED PITTS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1445.wav	AS TO THE REST OF THE AFFAIR INSIDE THE BANK I TAKE THE ACCOUNT OF A NORTHFIELD NARRATOR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1446.wav	WHERE'S THE MONEY OUTSIDE THE SAFE BOB ASKED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1447.wav	THE SHUTTERS WERE CLOSED AND THIS CAUSED BUNKER AN INSTANT'S DELAY THAT WAS ALMOST FATAL PITTS CHASED HIM WITH A BULLET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1448.wav	THE FIRST ONE MISSED HIM BUT THE SECOND WENT THROUGH HIS RIGHT SHOULDER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1449.wav	EDUCATED PEOPLE OF THE UPPER CLASSES ARE TRYING TO STIFLE THE EVER GROWING SENSE OF THE NECESSITY OF TRANSFORMING THE EXISTING SOCIAL ORDER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1450.wav	THIS IS ABSOLUTELY INCORRECT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1451.wav	IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IT IS SUPPOSED THAT SINCE THE AIM OF LIFE IS FOUND IN GROUPS OF INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALS WILL VOLUNTARILY SACRIFICE THEIR OWN INTERESTS FOR THE INTERESTS OF THE GROUP
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1452.wav	THE CHAMPIONS OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE USUALLY TRY TO CONNECT THE IDEA OF AUTHORITY THAT IS OF VIOLENCE WITH THE IDEA OF MORAL INFLUENCE BUT THIS CONNECTION IS QUITE IMPOSSIBLE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1453.wav	THE MAN WHO IS CONTROLLED BY MORAL INFLUENCE ACTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH HIS OWN DESIRES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1454.wav	THE BASIS OF AUTHORITY IS BODILY VIOLENCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1455.wav	THE POSSIBILITY OF APPLYING BODILY VIOLENCE TO PEOPLE IS PROVIDED ABOVE ALL BY AN ORGANIZATION OF ARMED MEN TRAINED TO ACT IN UNISON IN SUBMISSION TO ONE WILL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1456.wav	THESE BANDS OF ARMED MEN SUBMISSIVE TO A SINGLE WILL ARE WHAT CONSTITUTE THE ARMY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1457.wav	THE ARMY HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS THE BASIS OF POWER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1458.wav	POWER IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THOSE WHO CONTROL THE ARMY AND ALL MEN IN POWER FROM THE ROMAN CAESARS TO THE RUSSIAN AND GERMAN EMPERORS TAKE MORE INTEREST IN THEIR ARMY THAN IN ANYTHING AND COURT POPULARITY IN THE ARMY KNOWING THAT IF THAT IS ON THEIR SIDE THEIR POWER IS SECURE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1459.wav	INDEED IT COULD NOT BE OTHERWISE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1460.wav	ONLY UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS COULD THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BE JUSTIFIED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1461.wav	BUT SINCE THIS IS NOT THE CASE AND ON THE CONTRARY MEN IN POWER ARE ALWAYS FAR FROM BEING SAINTS THROUGH THE VERY FACT OF THEIR POSSESSION OF POWER THE SOCIAL ORGANIZATION BASED ON POWER HAS NO JUSTIFICATION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1462.wav	EVEN IF THERE WAS ONCE A TIME WHEN OWING TO THE LOW STANDARD OF MORALS AND THE DISPOSITION OF MEN TO VIOLENCE THE EXISTENCE OF AN AUTHORITY TO RESTRAIN SUCH VIOLENCE WAS AN ADVANTAGE BECAUSE THE VIOLENCE OF GOVERNMENT WAS LESS THAN THE VIOLENCE OF INDIVIDUALS ONE CANNOT BUT SEE THAT THIS ADVANTAGE COULD NOT BE LASTING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1463.wav	BETWEEN THE MEMBERS OF ONE STATE SUBJECT TO A SINGLE AUTHORITY THE STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS SEEMS STILL LESS AND THE LIFE OF THE STATE SEEMS EVEN MORE SECURE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1464.wav	IT WAS PRODUCED ON ONE HAND BY THE NATURAL GROWTH OF POPULATION AND ON THE OTHER BY STRUGGLE AND CONQUEST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1465.wav	AFTER CONQUEST THE POWER OF THE EMPEROR PUTS AN END TO INTERNAL DISSENSIONS AND SO THE STATE CONCEPTION OF LIFE JUSTIFIES ITSELF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1466.wav	BUT THIS JUSTIFICATION IS NEVER MORE THAN TEMPORARY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1467.wav	INTERNAL DISSENSIONS DISAPPEAR ONLY IN PROPORTION TO THE DEGREE OF OPPRESSION EXERTED BY THE AUTHORITY OVER THE DISSENTIENT INDIVIDUALS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1468.wav	GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY EVEN IF IT DOES SUPPRESS PRIVATE VIOLENCE ALWAYS INTRODUCES INTO THE LIFE OF MEN FRESH FORMS OF VIOLENCE WHICH TEND TO BECOME GREATER AND GREATER IN PROPORTION TO THE DURATION AND STRENGTH OF THE GOVERNMENT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1469.wav	AND THEREFORE THE OPPRESSION OF THE OPPRESSED ALWAYS GOES ON GROWING UP TO THE FURTHEST LIMIT BEYOND WHICH IT CANNOT GO WITHOUT KILLING THE GOOSE WITH THE GOLDEN EGGS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1470.wav	THE MOST CONVINCING EXAMPLE OF THIS IS TO BE FOUND IN THE CONDITION OF THE WORKING CLASSES OF OUR EPOCH WHO ARE IN REALITY NO BETTER THAN THE SLAVES OF ANCIENT TIMES SUBDUED BY CONQUEST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1471.wav	SO IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1472.wav	FOOTNOTE THE FACT THAT IN AMERICA THE ABUSES OF AUTHORITY EXIST IN SPITE OF THE SMALL NUMBER OF THEIR TROOPS NOT ONLY FAILS TO DISPROVE THIS POSITION BUT POSITIVELY CONFIRMS IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1473.wav	THE UPPER CLASSES KNOW THAT AN ARMY OF FIFTY THOUSAND WILL SOON BE INSUFFICIENT AND NO LONGER RELYING ON PINKERTON'S MEN THEY FEEL THAT THE SECURITY OF THEIR POSITION DEPENDS ON THE INCREASED STRENGTH OF THE ARMY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1474.wav	THE REASON TO WHICH HE GAVE EXPRESSION IS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT WHICH MADE THE FRENCH KINGS AND THE POPES ENGAGE SWISS AND SCOTCH GUARDS AND MAKES THE RUSSIAN AUTHORITIES OF TO DAY SO CAREFULLY DISTRIBUTE THE RECRUITS SO THAT THE REGIMENTS FROM THE FRONTIERS ARE STATIONED IN CENTRAL DISTRICTS AND THE REGIMENTS FROM THE CENTER ARE STATIONED ON THE FRONTIERS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1475.wav	THE MEANING OF CAPRIVI'S SPEECH PUT INTO PLAIN LANGUAGE IS THAT FUNDS ARE NEEDED NOT TO RESIST FOREIGN FOES BUT TO BUY UNDER OFFICERS TO BE READY TO ACT AGAINST THE ENSLAVED TOILING MASSES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1476.wav	AND THIS ABNORMAL ORDER OF THINGS IS MAINTAINED BY THE ARMY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1477.wav	BUT THERE IS NOT ONLY ONE GOVERNMENT THERE ARE OTHER GOVERNMENTS EXPLOITING THEIR SUBJECTS BY VIOLENCE IN THE SAME WAY AND ALWAYS READY TO POUNCE DOWN ON ANY OTHER GOVERNMENT AND CARRY OFF THE FRUITS OF THE TOIL OF ITS ENSLAVED SUBJECTS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1478.wav	AND SO EVERY GOVERNMENT NEEDS AN ARMY ALSO TO PROTECT ITS BOOTY FROM ITS NEIGHBOR BRIGANDS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1479.wav	THIS INCREASE IS CONTAGIOUS AS MONTESQUIEU POINTED OUT ONE HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS AGO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1480.wav	EVERY INCREASE IN THE ARMY OF ONE STATE WITH THE AIM OF SELF DEFENSE AGAINST ITS SUBJECTS BECOMES A SOURCE OF DANGER FOR NEIGHBORING STATES AND CALLS FOR A SIMILAR INCREASE IN THEIR ARMIES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1481.wav	THE DESPOTISM OF A GOVERNMENT ALWAYS INCREASES WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE ARMY AND ITS EXTERNAL SUCCESSES AND THE AGGRESSIVENESS OF A GOVERNMENT INCREASES WITH ITS INTERNAL DESPOTISM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1482.wav	THE RIVALRY OF THE EUROPEAN STATES IN CONSTANTLY INCREASING THEIR FORCES HAS REDUCED THEM TO THE NECESSITY OF HAVING RECOURSE TO UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE SINCE BY THAT MEANS THE GREATEST POSSIBLE NUMBER OF SOLDIERS IS OBTAINED AT THE LEAST POSSIBLE EXPENSE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1483.wav	AND BY THIS MEANS ALL CITIZENS ARE UNDER ARMS TO SUPPORT THE INIQUITIES PRACTICED UPON THEM ALL CITIZENS HAVE BECOME THEIR OWN OPPRESSORS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1484.wav	THIS INCONSISTENCY HAS BECOME OBVIOUS IN UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1485.wav	IN FACT THE WHOLE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE CONSISTS IN MAN'S RECOGNITION OF THE BARBARITY OF STRIFE BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS AND THE TRANSITORINESS OF PERSONAL LIFE ITSELF AND THE TRANSFERENCE OF THE AIM OF LIFE TO GROUPS OF PERSONS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1486.wav	BUT WITH UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE IT COMES TO PASS THAT MEN AFTER MAKING EVERY SACRIFICE TO GET RID OF THE CRUELTY OF STRIFE AND THE INSECURITY OF EXISTENCE ARE CALLED UPON TO FACE ALL THE PERILS THEY HAD MEANT TO AVOID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1487.wav	BUT INSTEAD OF DOING THAT THEY EXPOSE THE INDIVIDUALS TO THE SAME NECESSITY OF STRIFE SUBSTITUTING STRIFE WITH INDIVIDUALS OF OTHER STATES FOR STRIFE WITH NEIGHBORS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1488.wav	THE TAXES RAISED FROM THE PEOPLE FOR WAR PREPARATIONS ABSORB THE GREATER PART OF THE PRODUCE OF LABOR WHICH THE ARMY OUGHT TO DEFEND
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1489.wav	THE DANGER OF WAR EVER READY TO BREAK OUT RENDERS ALL REFORMS OF LIFE SOCIAL LIFE VAIN AND FRUITLESS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1490.wav	BUT THE FATAL SIGNIFICANCE OF UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE AS THE MANIFESTATION OF THE CONTRADICTION INHERENT IN THE SOCIAL CONCEPTION OF LIFE IS NOT ONLY APPARENT IN THAT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1491.wav	GOVERNMENTS ASSERT THAT ARMIES ARE NEEDED ABOVE ALL FOR EXTERNAL DEFENSE BUT THAT IS NOT TRUE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1492.wav	THEY ARE NEEDED PRINCIPALLY AGAINST THEIR SUBJECTS AND EVERY MAN UNDER UNIVERSAL MILITARY SERVICE BECOMES AN ACCOMPLICE IN ALL THE ACTS OF VIOLENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT AGAINST THE CITIZENS WITHOUT ANY CHOICE OF HIS OWN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1493.wav	AND FOR THE SAKE OF WHAT AM I MAKING THEM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1494.wav	I AM EXPECTED FOR THE SAKE OF THE STATE TO MAKE THESE SACRIFICES TO RENOUNCE EVERYTHING THAT CAN BE PRECIOUS TO MAN PEACE FAMILY SECURITY AND HUMAN DIGNITY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1495.wav	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY SAY WE SHOULD BE EXPOSED TO THE ATTACKS OF EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1496.wav	WE KNOW NOW THAT THREATS AND PUNISHMENTS CANNOT DIMINISH THEIR NUMBER THAT THAT CAN ONLY BE DONE BY CHANGE OF ENVIRONMENT AND MORAL INFLUENCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1497.wav	SO THAT THE JUSTIFICATION OF STATE VIOLENCE ON THE GROUND OF THE PROTECTION IT GIVES US FROM EVIL DISPOSED PERSONS EVEN IF IT HAD SOME FOUNDATION THREE OR FOUR CENTURIES AGO HAS NONE WHATEVER NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1498.wav	EXCEPT FOR THE STATE THEY TELL US WE SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY RELIGION EDUCATION CULTURE MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO ON
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1499.wav	WITHOUT THE STATE MEN WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO FORM THE SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEEDED FOR DOING ANY THING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/1500.wav	THIS ARGUMENT TOO WAS WELL FOUNDED ONLY SOME CENTURIES AGO

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2143.wav	NEVER MIND WHAT THE BUSINESS WAS IT SUFFICES TO SAY THAT IT WAS A GOOD BEGINNING FOR A YOUNG MAN LIKE TOM WHO HAVING BEEN BORN AND BRED IN THE MOST CONSERVATIVE CLASS OF THE MOST CONCEITED CITY IN NEW ENGLAND NEEDED JUST THE HEALTHY HEARTY SOCIAL INFLUENCES OF THE WEST TO WIDEN HIS VIEWS AND MAKE A MAN OF HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2144.wav	FORTUNATELY EVERY ONE WAS SO BUSY WITH THE NECESSARY PREPARATIONS THAT THERE WAS NO TIME FOR ROMANCE OF ANY SORT AND THE FOUR YOUNG PEOPLE WORKED TOGETHER AS SOBERLY AND SENSIBLY AS IF ALL SORTS OF EMOTIONS WERE NOT BOTTLED UP IN THEIR RESPECTIVE HEARTS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2145.wav	PITY THAT THE END SHOULD COME SO SOON BUT THE HOUR DID ITS WORK AND WENT ITS WAY LEAVING A CLEARER ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THOUGH THE YOUNG FOLKS DID NOT SEE IT THEN FOR THEIR EYES WERE DIM BECAUSE OF THE PARTINGS THAT MUST BE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2146.wav	IF IT HAD NOT BEEN FOR TWO THINGS I FEAR SHE NEVER WOULD HAVE STOOD A SUMMER IN TOWN BUT SYDNEY OFTEN CALLED TILL HIS VACATION CAME AND A VOLUMINOUS CORRESPONDENCE WITH POLLY BEGUILED THE LONG DAYS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2147.wav	TOM WROTE ONCE A WEEK TO HIS MOTHER BUT THE LETTERS WERE SHORT AND NOT VERY SATISFACTORY FOR MEN NEVER DO TELL THE INTERESTING LITTLE THINGS THAT WOMEN BEST LIKE TO HEAR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2148.wav	NO I M ONLY TIRED HAD A GOOD DEAL TO DO LATELY AND THE DULL WEATHER MAKES ME JUST A TRIFLE BLUE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2149.wav	FORGIVE ME POLLY BUT I CAN'T HELP SAYING IT FOR IT IS THERE AND I WANT TO BE AS TRUE TO YOU AS YOU WERE TO ME IF I CAN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2150.wav	I TRY NOT TO DECEIVE MYSELF BUT IT DOES SEEM AS IF THERE WAS A CHANCE OF HAPPINESS FOR ME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2151.wav	THANK HEAVEN FOR THAT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2152.wav	CRIED POLLY WITH THE HEARTIEST SATISFACTION IN HER VOICE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2153.wav	POOR POLLY WAS SO TAKEN BY SURPRISE THAT SHE HAD NOT A WORD TO SAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2154.wav	NONE WERE NEEDED HER TELLTALE FACE ANSWERED FOR HER AS WELL AS THE IMPULSE WHICH MADE HER HIDE HER HEAD IN THE SOFA CUSHION LIKE A FOOLISH OSTRICH WHEN THE HUNTERS ARE AFTER IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2155.wav	ONCE OR TWICE BUT SORT OF JOKINGLY AND I THOUGHT IT WAS ONLY SOME LITTLE FLIRTATION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2156.wav	IT WAS SO STUPID OF ME NOT TO GUESS BEFORE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2157.wav	IT WAS SO TENDER EARNEST AND DEFIANT THAT FANNY FORGOT THE DEFENCE OF HER OWN LOVER IN ADMIRATION OF POLLY'S LOYALTY TO HERS FOR THIS FAITHFUL ALL ABSORBING LOVE WAS A NEW REVELATION TO FANNY WHO WAS USED TO HEARING HER FRIENDS BOAST OF TWO OR THREE LOVERS A YEAR AND CALCULATE THEIR RESPECTIVE VALUES WITH ALMOST AS MUCH COOLNESS AS THE YOUNG MEN DISCUSSED THE FORTUNES OF THE GIRLS THEY WISHED FOR BUT COULD NOT AFFORD TO MARRY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2158.wav	I HOPE MARIA BAILEY IS ALL HE THINKS HER SHE ADDED SOFTLY FOR I COULD N'T BEAR TO HAVE HIM DISAPPOINTED AGAIN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2159.wav	SAID FANNY TURNING HOPEFUL ALL AT ONCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2160.wav	SUPPOSE I SAY A WORD TO TOM JUST INQUIRE AFTER HIS HEART IN A GENERAL WAY YOU KNOW AND GIVE HIM A CHANCE TO TELL ME IF THERE IS ANYTHING TO TELL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2161.wav	BEAR IT PEOPLE ALWAYS DO BEAR THINGS SOMEHOW ANSWERED POLLY LOOKING AS IF SENTENCE HAD BEEN PASSED UPON HER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2162.wav	IT WAS A VERY DIFFERENT WINTER FROM THE LAST FOR BOTH THE GIRLS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2163.wav	IF FANNY WANTED TO SHOW HIM WHAT SHE COULD DO TOWARD MAKING A PLEASANT HOME SHE CERTAINLY SUCCEEDED BETTER THAN SHE SUSPECTED FOR IN SPITE OF MANY FAILURES AND DISCOURAGEMENTS BEHIND THE SCENES THE LITTLE HOUSE BECAME A MOST ATTRACTIVE PLACE TO MISTER SYDNEY AT LEAST FOR HE WAS MORE THE HOUSE FRIEND THAN EVER AND SEEMED DETERMINED TO PROVE THAT CHANGE OF FORTUNE MADE NO DIFFERENCE TO HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2164.wav	SHE KEPT MUCH AT HOME WHEN THE DAY'S WORK WAS DONE FINDING IT PLEASANTER TO SIT DREAMING OVER BOOK OR SEWING ALONE THAN TO EXERT HERSELF EVEN TO GO TO THE SHAWS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2165.wav	POLLY WAS NOT AT ALL LIKE HERSELF THAT WINTER AND THOSE NEAREST TO HER SAW AND WONDERED AT IT MOST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2166.wav	FOR NED WAS SO ABSORBED IN BUSINESS THAT HE IGNORED THE WHOLE BAILEY QUESTION AND LEFT THEM IN UTTER DARKNESS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2167.wav	FANNY CAME WALKING IN UPON HER ONE DAY LOOKING AS IF SHE BROUGHT TIDINGS OF SUCH GREAT JOY THAT SHE HARDLY KNEW HOW TO TELL THEM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2168.wav	BUT IF WORK BASKETS WERE GIFTED WITH POWERS OF SPEECH THEY COULD TELL STORIES MORE TRUE AND TENDER THAN ANY WE READ
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2169.wav	SHE PULLED HER HAIR DOWN TURNED HER SKIRT BACK PUT HER FEET ON THE FENDER AND TOOK PUTTEL INTO HER LAP ALL OF WHICH ARRANGEMENTS SIGNIFIED THAT SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT HAD GOT TO BE THOUGHT OVER AND SETTLED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2170.wav	THE MORE PROPOSALS THE MORE CREDIT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2171.wav	I VE TRIED IT AND LIKED IT AND MAYBE THIS IS THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT NIGHT'S FUN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2172.wav	JUST SUPPOSE IT IS TRUE THAT HE DOES ASK ME AND I SAY YES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2173.wav	WHAT A SPITEFUL THING I AM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2174.wav	I COULD DO SO MUCH FOR ALL AT HOME HOW I SHOULD ENJOY THAT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2175.wav	LET ME SEE HOW CAN I BEGIN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2176.wav	HE HAS KNOWN HER ALL HER LIFE AND HAS A GOOD INFLUENCE OVER HER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2177.wav	NOW AS POLLY WAS BY NO MEANS A PERFECT CREATURE I AM FREE TO CONFESS THAT THE OLD TEMPTATION ASSAILED HER MORE THAN ONCE THAT WEEK FOR WHEN THE FIRST EXCITEMENT OF THE DODGING REFORM HAD SUBSIDED SHE MISSED THE PLEASANT LITTLE INTERVIEWS THAT USED TO PUT A CERTAIN FLAVOR OF ROMANCE INTO HER DULL HARD WORKING DAYS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2178.wav	I DON'T THINK IT WAS HIS WEALTH ACCOMPLISHMENTS OR POSITION THAT MOST ATTRACTED POLLY THOUGH THESE DOUBTLESS POSSESSED A GREATER INFLUENCE THAN SHE SUSPECTED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2179.wav	IT WAS THAT INDESCRIBABLE SOMETHING WHICH WOMEN ARE QUICK TO SEE AND FEEL IN MEN WHO HAVE BEEN BLESSED WITH WISE AND GOOD MOTHERS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2180.wav	THIS HAD AN ESPECIAL CHARM TO POLLY FOR SHE SOON FOUND THAT THIS SIDE OF HIS CHARACTER WAS NOT SHOWN TO EVERY ONE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2181.wav	LATELY THIS HAD CHANGED ESPECIALLY TOWARDS POLLY AND IT FLATTERED HER MORE THAN SHE WOULD CONFESS EVEN TO HERSELF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2182.wav	AT FIRST SHE TRIED TO THINK SHE COULD BUT UNFORTUNATELY HEARTS ARE SO CONTRARY THAT THEY WON'T BE OBEDIENT TO REASON WILL OR EVEN GRATITUDE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2183.wav	POLLY FELT A VERY CORDIAL FRIENDSHIP FOR MISTER SYDNEY BUT NOT ONE PARTICLE OF THE LOVE WHICH IS THE ONLY COIN IN WHICH LOVE CAN BE TRULY PAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2184.wav	THIS FINISHED POLLY'S INDECISION AND AFTER THAT NIGHT SHE NEVER ALLOWED HERSELF TO DWELL UPON THE PLEASANT TEMPTATION WHICH CAME IN A GUISE PARTICULARLY ATTRACTIVE TO A YOUNG GIRL WITH A SPICE OF THE OLD EVE IN HER COMPOSITION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2185.wav	WHEN SATURDAY CAME POLLY STARTED AS USUAL FOR A VISIT TO BECKY AND BESS BUT COULD N'T RESIST STOPPING AT THE SHAWS TO LEAVE A LITTLE PARCEL FOR FAN THOUGH IT WAS CALLING TIME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2186.wav	A FOOLISH LITTLE SPEECH TO MAKE TO A DOG BUT YOU SEE POLLY WAS ONLY A TENDER HEARTED GIRL TRYING TO DO HER DUTY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2187.wav	TAKE HOLD OF MASTER CHARLEY'S HAND MISS MAMIE AND WALK PRETTY LIKE WILLY AND FLOSSY SAID THE MAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2188.wav	AT A STREET CORNER A BLACK EYED SCHOOL BOY WAS PARTING FROM A ROSY FACED SCHOOL GIRL WHOSE MUSIC ROLL HE WAS RELUCTANTLY SURRENDERING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2189.wav	HOW HE GOT THERE WAS NEVER VERY CLEAR TO POLLY BUT THERE HE WAS FLUSHED AND A LITTLE OUT OF BREATH BUT LOOKING SO GLAD TO SEE HER THAT SHE HAD N'T THE HEART TO BE STIFF AND COOL AS SHE HAD FULLY INTENDED TO BE WHEN THEY MET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2190.wav	SHE REALLY COULD N'T HELP IT IT WAS SO PLEASANT TO SEE HIM AGAIN JUST WHEN SHE WAS FEELING SO LONELY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2191.wav	THAT IS THE WAY I GET TO THE ROTHS ANSWERED POLLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2192.wav	SHE DID NOT MEAN TO TELL BUT HIS FRANKNESS WAS SO AGREEABLE SHE FORGOT HERSELF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2193.wav	BUT I KNOW HER BETTER AND I ASSURE YOU THAT SHE DOES IMPROVE SHE TRIES TO MEND HER FAULTS THOUGH SHE WON'T OWN IT AND WILL SURPRISE YOU SOME DAY BY THE AMOUNT OF HEART AND SENSE AND GOODNESS SHE HAS GOT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2194.wav	THANK YOU NO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2195.wav	HOW LOVELY THE PARK LOOKS SHE SAID IN GREAT CONFUSION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2196.wav	ASKED THE ARTFUL YOUNG MAN LAYING A TRAP INTO WHICH POLLY IMMEDIATELY FELL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2197.wav	HE WAS QUICKER TO TAKE A HINT THAN SHE HAD EXPECTED AND BEING BOTH PROUD AND GENEROUS RESOLVED TO SETTLE THE MATTER AT ONCE FOR POLLY'S SAKE AS WELL AS HIS OWN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2198.wav	SO WHEN SHE MADE HER LAST BRILLIANT REMARK HE SAID QUIETLY WATCHING HER FACE KEENLY ALL THE WHILE I THOUGHT SO WELL I M GOING OUT OF TOWN ON BUSINESS FOR SEVERAL WEEKS SO YOU CAN ENJOY YOUR LITTLE BIT OF COUNTRY WITHOUT BEING ANNOYED BY ME ANNOYED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2199.wav	SHE THOUGHT SHE HAD A GOOD DEAL OF THE COQUETTE IN HER AND I VE NO DOUBT THAT WITH TIME AND TRAINING SHE WOULD HAVE BECOME A VERY DANGEROUS LITTLE PERSON BUT NOW SHE WAS FAR TOO TRANSPARENT AND STRAIGHTFORWARD BY NATURE EVEN TO TELL A WHITE LIE CLEVERLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2200.wav	HE WAS GONE BEFORE SHE COULD DO ANYTHING BUT LOOK UP AT HIM WITH A REMORSEFUL FACE AND SHE WALKED ON FEELING THAT THE FIRST AND PERHAPS THE ONLY LOVER SHE WOULD EVER HAVE HAD READ HIS ANSWER AND ACCEPTED IT IN SILENCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2201.wav	POLLY DID NOT RETURN TO HER FAVORITE WALK TILL SHE LEARNED FROM MINNIE THAT UNCLE HAD REALLY LEFT TOWN AND THEN SHE FOUND THAT HIS FRIENDLY COMPANY AND CONVERSATION WAS WHAT HAD MADE THE WAY SO PLEASANT AFTER ALL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2202.wav	WAGGING TO AND FRO AS USUAL WHAT'S THE NEWS WITH YOU
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2203.wav	PERHAPS SHE LL JILT HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2204.wav	UTTERLY DONE WITH AND LAID UPON THE SHELF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2205.wav	MINNIE SAID THE OTHER DAY SHE WISHED SHE WAS A PIGEON SO SHE COULD PADDLE IN THE PUDDLES AND NOT FUSS ABOUT RUBBERS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2206.wav	NOW DON'T BE AFFECTED POLLY BUT JUST TELL ME LIKE A DEAR HAS N'T HE PROPOSED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2207.wav	DON'T YOU THINK HE MEANS TO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2208.wav	TRULY TRULY FAN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2209.wav	I DON'T MEAN TO BE PRYING BUT I REALLY THOUGHT HE DID

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2211.wav	I JUST GAVE HIM A HINT AND HE TOOK IT

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2213.wav	HE UNDERSTOOD AND BEING A GENTLEMAN MADE NO FUSS

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2234.wav	BUT THIS WORKED BOTH WAYS THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONISTS DECIDED THAT IF THE CONGRESS HAD NO POWER OVER THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE THEN THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE HAD NO POWER OVER THE CONGRESS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2235.wav	ON THE TWENTY SEVENTH OCCURRED THE DEBATE ON THE LAND QUESTION WHICH REVEALED THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE AGRARIAN PROGRAMME OF THE BOLSHEVIKI AND THE LEFT SOCIALIST REVOLUTIONARIES

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2427.wav	ONE OF TWO THINGS WILL HAPPEN HE WILL EITHER BE SOBER OR HE WILL NOT BE SOBER

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2431.wav	WHAT WITH THE ONE WINDOW AND THE LOWERING DAY OUTSIDE THE LONG NARROW SHOP WAS SOMBER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2432.wav	HEAVY HAND HEWN BEAMS CROSSED IT FROM ONE SIDE TO THE OTHER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2433.wav	MISTER WICKER'S BACK BEING TOWARD THE SOURCE OF LIGHT CHRIS COULD NOT SEE HIS FACE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2434.wav	THE DOUBLE FANS OF MINUTE WRINKLES BREAKING FROM EYE CORNER TO TEMPLE AND JOINING WITH THOSE OVER THE CHEEKBONES WERE DRAWN INTO THE HORIZONTAL LINES ACROSS THE DOMED FOREHEAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2435.wav	LITTLE TUFTS OF WHITE FUZZ ABOVE THE EARS WERE ALL THAT REMAINED OF THE ANTIQUARIAN'S HAIR BUT WHAT DREW AND HELD CHRIS'S GAZE WERE THE OLD MAN'S EYES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2436.wav	CHRIS BLINKED AND LOOKED AGAIN YES THEY WERE STILL THERE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2437.wav	CHRIS SWALLOWED AND HIS VOICE CAME BACK TO HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2438.wav	YES SIR HE SAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2439.wav	I SAW YOUR SIGN AND I KNOW A BOY WHO NEEDS THE JOB
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2440.wav	HE'S A SCHOOLMATE OF MINE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2441.wav	JAKEY HARRIS HIS NAME IS AND HE REALLY NEEDS THE JOB
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2442.wav	I I JUST WONDERED IF THE PLACE WAS STILL OPEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2443.wav	WHAT HE SAW WAS A FRESH CHEEKED LAD TALL FOR THIRTEEN STURDY WITH SINCERITY AND GOOD HUMOR IN HIS FACE AND SOMETHING SENSITIVE AND APPEALING ABOUT HIS EYES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2444.wav	HE GUESSED THERE MUST BE A LIVELY FIRE IN THAT ROOM BEYOND
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2445.wav	WOULD THAT INTERFERE WITH JAKEY'S GETTING THE JOB SIR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2446.wav	BUT EVEN AS HE SLOWLY TURNED THE THOUGHT PIERCED HIS MIND WHY HAD HE NOT SEEN THE REFLECTION OF THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE CARS MOVING UP AROUND THE CORNER OF WATER STREET AND UP THE HILL TOWARD THE TRAFFIC SIGNALS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2447.wav	THE ROOM SEEMED OVERLY STILL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2448.wav	THEN IN THAT SECOND HE TURNED AND FACED ABOUT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2449.wav	THE WIDE BOW WINDOW WAS THERE BEFORE HIM THE THREE OBJECTS HE LIKED BEST SHOWING FROSTY IN THE MOONLIGHT THAT POURED IN FROM ACROSS THE WATER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2450.wav	ACROSS THE WATER WHERE WAS THE FREEWAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2451.wav	IT WAS NO LONGER THERE NOR WERE THE HIGH WALLS AND SMOKESTACKS OF FACTORIES TO BE SEEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2452.wav	THE WAREHOUSES WERE STILL THERE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2453.wav	FLABBERGASTED AND BREATHLESS CHRIS WAS UNAWARE THAT HE HAD MOVED CLOSER TO PEER OUT THE WINDOW IN EVERY DIRECTION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2454.wav	NO ELECTRIC SIGNS NO LAMPLIT STREETS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2455.wav	WHERE THE PEOPLE'S DRUGSTORE HAD STOOD BUT A HALF HOUR BEFORE ROSE THE ROOFS OF WHAT WAS EVIDENTLY AN INN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2456.wav	A COURTYARD WAS SPARSELY LIT BY A FLARING TORCH OR TWO SHOWING A SWINGING SIGN HUNG ON A POST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2457.wav	THE POST WAS PLANTED AT THE EDGE OF WHAT WAS NOW A BROAD AND MUDDY ROAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2458.wav	A COACH WITH ITS TOP PILED HIGH WITH LUGGAGE STAMPED TO A HALT BESIDE THE FLAGGED COURTYARD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2459.wav	THEY MOVED INTO THE INN THE COACH RATTLED OFF TO THE STABLE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2460.wav	MY WINDOW HAS A POWER FOR THOSE FEW WHO ARE TO SEE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2461.wav	THE LEARNING OF MAGIC WAS BY NO MEANS EASY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2462.wav	HE HAD TOLD HIS MASTER AT ONCE ABOUT SIMON GOSLER HIS HORDE OF MONEY AND HIS HIDING PLACES FOR IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2463.wav	CHRIS THEREFORE THREW HIMSELF INTO ALL THE PRELIMINARIES OF HIS TASK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2464.wav	ONE AFTERNOON WHEN HE RETURNED AFTER A REST TO MISTER WICKER'S STUDY HE SAW THAT THERE WAS SOMETHING NEW IN THE ROOM A BOWL WITH A GOLDFISH IN IT STOOD ON THE TABLE BUT MISTER WICKER WAS NOT TO BE SEEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2465.wav	WHAT SHALL I DO FIRST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2466.wav	HOW YOU HAVE IMPROVED MY BOY HE EXCLAIMED IT IS NOW TIME FOR YOU TO TRY AND THIS IS AS GOOD A CHANGE AS ANY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2467.wav	SUPPOSE I CHANGE AND CAN'T CHANGE BACK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2468.wav	MISTER WICKER WAITED PATIENTLY BESIDE HIM FOR A FEW MOMENTS FOR CHRIS TO GET UP HIS COURAGE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2469.wav	THEN AS NOTHING HAPPENED WITH A VOICE LIKE A WHIP MISTER WICKER SAID START AT ONCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2470.wav	THE SENSATION SPREAD FASTER AND FASTER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2471.wav	HIS HEAD SWAM AND HE FELT FAINT AND A LITTLE SICK BUT HE PERSISTED THROUGH THE FINAL WORDS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2472.wav	HE THOUGHT NOT WITHOUT A FEELING OF PRIDE AND COMMENCED EXPERIMENTING WITH HIS TAIL AND FINS WITH SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND DELIGHT THAT SOME LITTLE TIME ELAPSED BEFORE MISTER WICKER'S VOICE BOOMED CLOSE BY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2473.wav	SEVENTY FOUR BOOK ONE THE RETURN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2474.wav	THE FIGURE'S SHOES CARVED IN SOME EASTERN STYLE HAD CURVED UP POINTING TOES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2475.wav	THEN ALL AT ONCE THE IDEA CAME TO CHRIS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2476.wav	IF HE WAS TO BE A MAGICIAN COULD HE MAKE THIS BOY COME TO LIFE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2477.wav	HE SQUATTED ON HIS HAUNCHES EXAMINING THE CARVED WOODEN FIGURE ATTENTIVELY AND FELT CONVINCED THAT ONCE ALIVE THE BOY WOULD BE AN IDEAL AND HAPPY COMPANION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2478.wav	BUT HOW DID ONE CHANGE INANIMATE TO ANIMATE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2479.wav	CHRIS GOT UP AND STOLE BACK TO MISTER WICKER'S DOOR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2480.wav	HE HEARD THE MAGICIAN GOING UP THE SPIRAL STAIRCASE TO HIS ROOM ABOVE AND AFTER CHANGING HIMSELF TO A MOUSE TO SLIP UNDER THE DOOR AND SEE THAT THE ROOM WAS REALLY EMPTY CHRIS RESUMED HIS PROPER SHAPE AND OPENED THE DOORS OF THE CUPBOARD AT THE FAR END OF THE ROOM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2481.wav	THE AFTERNOON RAINY BEFORE INCREASED IN STORM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2482.wav	DUSK CAME TWO HOURS BEFORE ITS TIME THUNDER SNARLED IN THE SKY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2483.wav	CERTAIN ELEMENTS WERE TO BE MIXED AND POURED AT THE PROPER TIME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2484.wav	MISTER WICKER BEGAN MOVING ABOUT UPSTAIRS THE FLOORBOARDS CREAKED AND STILL CHRIS COULD NOT LEAVE UNTIL THE POTION FUMED AND GLOWED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2485.wav	WITH INFINITE CAUTION CHRIS CLOSED THE DOOR SILENTLY BEHIND HIM AND RUNNING LIGHTLY FORWARD REACHED THE FIGURE OF THE NEGRO BOY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2486.wav	IT WAS AS IF THE STIFFNESS MELTED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2487.wav	UNDER HIS EYES THE WOODEN FOLDS OF CLOTH BECAME RICH SILK EMBROIDERY GLEAMED IN ITS REALITY UPON THE COAT AND OH THE FACE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2488.wav	THE WOODEN GRIN LOOSENED THE LARGE EYES TURNED THE HAND HOLDING THE HARD BOUQUET OF CARVED FLOWERS MOVED AND LET THE BOUQUET FALL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2489.wav	THEY WENT DOWN TO THEIR QUARTERS FIRST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2490.wav	GUESS MISTER FINNEY WENT TO HIS QUARTERS I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING HIM CROSS THE DECK OR COME OVER THAT WAY AT ALL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2491.wav	NEXT NED CILLEY WAS RELIEVED AT THE HELM BY ELBERT JONES WHO TOOK OVER NED WENT ON DOWN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2492.wav	IT LOOKS TO ME AS IF IT COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF SEVERAL PEOPLE AND I'LL BE SWITCHED IF I KNOW WHO I'LL KEEP MY EYES OPEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2493.wav	THE MIRABELLE WAS NEARING TAHITI
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2494.wav	WE'VE WATER AND FRESH STORES TO TAKE ON THERE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2495.wav	CHRIS LOST NO TIME AS SOON AS HE COULD DO IT WITHOUT BEING NOTICED IN HURRYING DOWN TO HIS CABIN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2496.wav	CERTAINLY MY BOY BOOMED OUT THE CAPTAIN HIS BLUE EYES ABRUPTLY KEEN AND PENETRATING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2497.wav	MISTER FINNEY WILL BE SOME TIME ON DECK WE CANNOT BE OVERHEARD IN HERE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2498.wav	HIS FACE FROZE WITH NERVOUSNESS THAT THIS MIGHT NOT DO AS AN ANSWER AND HE STOOD STIFF AND STILL BEFORE CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2499.wav	THE CAPTAIN SAT FORWARD IN HIS CHAIR LOOKING AT HIM FOR A LONG MOMENT CONSIDERING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2500.wav	THEN HE SAID WELL I DO NOT CARE FOR IT I CANNOT SAY I DO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2501.wav	THIS SHIP IS MORE TO ME THAN WIFE OR MOTHER OR FAMILY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2502.wav	HE PAUSED FINGERING HIS LOWER LIP AND LOOKING SIDEWAYS IN A REFLECTIVE FASHION AT CHRIS STANDING BEFORE HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2503.wav	WE SHALL SAY NO MORE BUT I TRUST YOU UNDERSTAND THE RESPONSIBILITY YOU HAVE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2504.wav	THIS SHIP ITS CARGO AND ITS MEN WILL BE IN YOUR HANDS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2505.wav	YES SIR I THINK I CAN DO IT SAFELY OR I SHOULD NOT TRY SIR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2506.wav	CAPTAIN BLIZZARD'S ROUND PINK FACE CREASED IN HIS WINNING SMILE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2507.wav	HE THEN WENT ON TO DESCRIBE WHAT ELSE WAS TO FOLLOW THE COVERING OF THE SHIP WITH LEAVES TO MAKE IT BLEND WITH ITS SURROUNDINGS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2508.wav	CAMOUFLAGE WAS NOT A WORD THE CAPTAIN OR ANYONE ELSE OF HIS TIME YET UNDERSTOOD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2509.wav	WHAT CAN BE SAID DURING THAT TIME SIR CHRIS THOUGHT TO ASK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2510.wav	I AM SOMEWHAT SKILLED IN MEDICAMENTS I HAVE TO BE AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP AND THE CREW KNOW IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2511.wav	I SHALL SAY THAT YOU ARE IN MY OWN CABIN SO THAT I CAN CARE FOR YOU
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2512.wav	NOT SINCE HE HAD LEFT MISTER WICKER HAD CHRIS FELT SUCH CONFIDENCE AS HE DID IN THE WORDS AND ACTIONS OF CAPTAIN BLIZZARD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2513.wav	HE KNEW NOW THAT HIS ABSENCE FOR AS LONG AS HE HAD TO BE AWAY WOULD BE COVERED UP AND SATISFACTORILY ACCOUNTED FOR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2514.wav	THEIR CONVERSATION HAD TAKEN SOME LITTLE WHILE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2515.wav	SAY YOU KNOW SUMTHIN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2516.wav	CHRIS LOOKED FROM A NICKEL PLATED FLASHLIGHT TO A CAR JACK AND SPARK PLUG
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2517.wav	KNOW WHO NEEDS A JOB BAD THAT'S JAKEY HARRIS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2518.wav	O K HE SAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2519.wav	ONLY WHY DIDN'T YOU ASK HIM YOURSELF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2520.wav	MIKE BECAME UNEASY AND FISHED AN ELASTIC BAND OUT OF HIS POCKET MADE A FLICK OF PAPER AND SENT IT SOARING OUT INTO M STREET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2521.wav	WELL HE ADMITTED I DID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2522.wav	CHRIS ASKED AND FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT DAY THE HEAVY WEIGHT HE CARRIED WITHIN HIM LIFTED AND LIGHTENED A LITTLE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2523.wav	THINK HE REALLY NEEDS IT HE PURSUED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2524.wav	HE WOULD HAVE LIKED TO GET THE JOB FOR JAKEY WHO NEEDED IT BUT SOMEHOW THE TASK OF FACING MISTER WICKER ESPECIALLY NOW THAT THE LIGHT WAS GOING AND DUSK EDGING INTO THE STREETS WAS NOT WHAT CHRIS HAD INTENDED FOR ENDING THE AFTERNOON
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2525.wav	MIKE'S EXPRESSION CHANGED AT ONCE TO ONE OF TRIUMPH BUT CHRIS WAS ONLY PARTLY ENCOURAGED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2526.wav	BETCHA AREN'T GOIN AFTER ALL CHRIS TURNED ON HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2527.wav	MIKE WAS STANDING ON THE CORNER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2528.wav	AW SHUCKS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2529.wav	CHRIS STARTED OFF ONCE MORE PASSING THE BLEAK LITTLE VICTORIAN CHURCH PERCHED ON THE HILL ABOVE MISTER WICKER'S HOUSE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2530.wav	AN EMPTY LOT CUT INTO BY CHURCH LANE GAVE A LOOK OF ISOLATION TO THE L SHAPED BRICK BUILDING THAT SERVED MISTER WICKER AS BOTH HOUSE AND PLACE OF BUSINESS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2531.wav	THE LONGER WING TOWARD THE BACK HAD A BACK DOOR THAT OPENED ONTO WATER STREET THE SPACE BETWEEN THE HOUSE AND WISCONSIN AVENUE HAD BEEN MADE INTO A NEAT OBLONG FLOWER GARDEN FENCED OFF FROM THE SIDEWALK BY BOX SHRUBS AND A WHITE PICKET FENCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2532.wav	A LIVID YELLOW STAINED THE HORIZON BEYOND THE FACTORIES AND GRAY CLOUDS LOWERED AND TUMBLED ABOVE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2533.wav	THE AIR WAS GROWING CHILL AND CHRIS DECIDED TO FINISH HIS JOB
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2534.wav	ALL AT ONCE HE WONDERED HOW HIS MOTHER WAS AND EVERYTHING IN HIM PINCHED AND TIGHTENED ITSELF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2535.wav	AT THE FOOT OF THE HILL HE REACHED THE HOUSE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2536.wav	THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT ALWAYS CAUGHT HIS EYE AMID THE LITTER OF DUSTY PIECES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2537.wav	ON THE LEFT THE COIL OF ROPE IN THE CENTER THE MODEL OF A SAILING SHIP IN A GREEN GLASS BOTTLE AND ON THE RIGHT THE WOODEN STATUE OF A NEGRO BOY IN BAGGY TROUSERS TURKISH JACKET AND WHITE TURBAN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2538.wav	BUT THE NAME STILL SHOWED AT THE PROW AND MANY A TIME CHRIS SAFE AT HOME IN BED HAD SAILED IMAGINARY VOYAGES IN THE MIRABELLE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2539.wav	HE HAD NEVER SEEN ANYONE GO INTO MISTER WICKER'S SHOP NOW HE THOUGHT OF IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2540.wav	HOW THEN DID HE LIVE AND WHAT DID HE EVER SELL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2541.wav	A SUDDEN CAR HORN WOKE HIM FROM HIS DREAM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2542.wav	WHEN IT WAS THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTEENTH NIGHT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2543.wav	BUT HE ANSWERED NEEDS MUST I HAVE ZAYNAB ALSO NOW SUDDENLY THERE CAME A RAP AT THE DOOR AND THE MAID SAID WHO IS AT THE DOOR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2544.wav	THE KNOCKER REPLIED KAMAR DAUGHTER OF AZARIAH THE JEW SAY ME IS ALI OF CAIRO WITH YOU
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2545.wav	REPLIED THE BROKER'S DAUGHTER O THOU DAUGHTER OF A DOG
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2546.wav	AND HAVING THUS ISLAMISED SHE ASKED HIM DO MEN IN THE FAITH OF AL ISLAM GIVE MARRIAGE PORTIONS TO WOMEN OR DO WOMEN DOWER MEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2547.wav	AND SHE THREW DOWN THE JEW'S HEAD BEFORE HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2548.wav	NOW THE CAUSE OF HER SLAYING HER SIRE WAS AS FOLLOWS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2549.wav	THEN HE SET OUT REJOICING TO RETURN TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2550.wav	SO HE ATE AND FELL DOWN SENSELESS FOR THE SWEETMEATS WERE DRUGGED WITH BHANG WHEREUPON THE KAZI BUNDLED HIM INTO THE SACK AND MADE OFF WITH HIM CHARGER AND CHEST AND ALL TO THE BARRACK OF THE FORTY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2551.wav	PRESENTLY HASAN SHUMAN CAME OUT OF A CLOSET AND SAID TO HIM HAST THOU GOTTEN THE GEAR O ALI
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2552.wav	SO HE TOLD HIM WHAT HAD BEFALLEN HIM AND ADDED IF I KNOW WHITHER THE RASCAL IS GONE AND WHERE TO FIND THE KNAVE I WOULD PAY HIM OUT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2553.wav	KNOWEST THOU WHITHER HE WENT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2554.wav	ANSWERED HASAN I KNOW WHERE HE IS AND OPENING THE DOOR OF THE CLOSET SHOWED HIM THE SWEETMEAT SELLER WITHIN DRUGGED AND SENSELESS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2555.wav	SO I WENT ROUND ABOUT THE HIGHWAYS OF THE CITY TILL I MET A SWEETMEAT SELLER AND BUYING HIS CLOTHES AND STOCK IN TRADE AND GEAR FOR TEN DINARS DID WHAT WAS DONE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2556.wav	QUOTH AL RASHID WHOSE HEAD IS THIS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2557.wav	SO ALI RELATED TO HIM ALL THAT HAD PASSED FROM FIRST TO LAST AND THE CALIPH SAID I HAD NOT THOUGHT THOU WOULDST KILL HIM FOR THAT HE WAS A SORCERER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2558.wav	HE REPLIED I HAVE FORTY LADS BUT THEY ARE IN CAIRO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2559.wav	HIS FOLLOWERS RUSHED FORWARD TO WHERE HE LAY AND THEIR UNITED FORCE COMPELLING THE BLACK KNIGHT TO PAUSE THEY DRAGGED THEIR WOUNDED LEADER WITHIN THE WALLS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2560.wav	IT WAS ON THEIR JOURNEY TO THAT TOWN THAT THEY WERE OVERTAKEN ON THE ROAD BY CEDRIC AND HIS PARTY IN WHOSE COMPANY THEY WERE AFTERWARDS CARRIED CAPTIVE TO THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2561.wav	AS HE LAY UPON HIS BED RACKED WITH PAIN AND MENTAL AGONY AND FILLED WITH THE FEAR OF RAPIDLY APPROACHING DEATH HE HEARD A VOICE ADDRESS HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2562.wav	WHAT ART THOU HE EXCLAIMED IN TERROR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2563.wav	LEAVE ME AND SEEK THE SAXON WITCH ULRICA WHO WAS MY TEMPTRESS LET HER AS WELL AS I TASTE THE TORTURES WHICH ANTICIPATE HELL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2564.wav	EXCLAIMED THE NORMAN HO

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2566.wav	THEY ARE FAST RISING AT LEAST SAID ULRICA AND A SIGNAL SHALL SOON WAVE TO WARN THE BESIEGERS TO PRESS HARD UPON THOSE WHO WOULD EXTINGUISH THEM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2567.wav	MEANWHILE THE BLACK KNIGHT HAD LED HIS FORCES AGAIN TO THE ATTACK AND SO VIGOROUS WAS THEIR ASSAULT THAT BEFORE LONG THE GATE OF THE CASTLE ALONE SEPARATED THEM FROM THOSE WITHIN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2568.wav	THE DEFENDERS FINDING THE CASTLE TO BE ON FIRE NOW DETERMINED TO SELL THEIR LIVES AS DEARLY AS THEY COULD AND HEADED BY DE BRACY THEY THREW OPEN THE GATE AND WERE AT ONCE INVOLVED IN A TERRIFIC CONFLICT WITH THOSE OUTSIDE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2569.wav	THE BLACK KNIGHT WITH PORTENTOUS STRENGTH FORCED HIS WAY INWARD IN DESPITE OF DE BRACY AND HIS FOLLOWERS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2570.wav	TWO OF THE FOREMOST INSTANTLY FELL AND THE REST GAVE WAY NOTWITHSTANDING ALL THEIR LEADERS EFFORTS TO STOP THEM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2571.wav	THE BLACK KNIGHT WAS SOON ENGAGED IN DESPERATE COMBAT WITH THE NORMAN CHIEF AND THE VAULTED ROOF OF THE HALL RUNG WITH THEIR FURIOUS BLOWS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2572.wav	AT LENGTH DE BRACY FELL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2573.wav	TELL ME THY NAME OR WORK THY PLEASURE ON ME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2574.wav	YET FIRST LET ME SAY SAID DE BRACY WHAT IT IMPORTS THEE TO KNOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2575.wav	EXCLAIMED THE BLACK KNIGHT PRISONER AND PERISH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2576.wav	THE LIFE OF EVERY MAN IN THE CASTLE SHALL ANSWER IT IF A HAIR OF HIS HEAD BE SINGED SHOW ME HIS CHAMBER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2577.wav	RAISING THE WOUNDED MAN WITH EASE THE BLACK KNIGHT RUSHED WITH HIM TO THE POSTERN GATE AND HAVING THERE DELIVERED HIS BURDEN TO THE CARE OF TWO YEOMEN HE AGAIN ENTERED THE CASTLE TO ASSIST IN THE RESCUE OF THE OTHER PRISONERS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2578.wav	BUT IN OTHER PARTS THE BESIEGERS PURSUED THE DEFENDERS OF THE CASTLE FROM CHAMBER TO CHAMBER AND SATIATED IN THEIR BLOOD THE VENGEANCE WHICH HAD LONG ANIMATED THEM AGAINST THE SOLDIERS OF THE TYRANT FRONT DE BOEUF
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2579.wav	AS THE FIRE COMMENCED TO SPREAD RAPIDLY THROUGH ALL PARTS OF THE CASTLE ULRICA APPEARED ON ONE OF THE TURRETS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2580.wav	BEFORE LONG THE TOWERING FLAMES HAD SURMOUNTED EVERY OBSTRUCTION AND ROSE TO THE EVENING SKIES ONE HUGE AND BURNING BEACON SEEN FAR AND WIDE THROUGH THE ADJACENT COUNTRY TOWER AFTER TOWER CRASHED DOWN WITH BLAZING ROOF AND RAFTER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2581.wav	AT LENGTH WITH A TERRIFIC CRASH THE WHOLE TURRET GAVE WAY AND SHE PERISHED IN THE FLAMES WHICH HAD CONSUMED HER TYRANT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2582.wav	WHEN THE OUTLAWS HAD DIVIDED THE SPOILS WHICH THEY HAD TAKEN FROM THE CASTLE OF TORQUILSTONE CEDRIC PREPARED TO TAKE HIS DEPARTURE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2583.wav	HE LEFT THE GALLANT BAND OF FORESTERS SORROWING DEEPLY FOR HIS LOST FRIEND THE LORD OF CONINGSBURGH AND HE AND HIS FOLLOWERS HAD SCARCE DEPARTED WHEN A PROCESSION MOVED SLOWLY FROM UNDER THE GREENWOOD BRANCHES IN THE DIRECTION WHICH HE HAD TAKEN IN THE CENTRE OF WHICH WAS THE CAR IN WHICH THE BODY OF ATHELSTANE WAS LAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2584.wav	DE BRACY BOWED LOW AND IN SILENCE THREW HIMSELF UPON A HORSE AND GALLOPED OFF THROUGH THE WOOD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2585.wav	HERE IS A BUGLE WHICH AN ENGLISH YEOMAN HAS ONCE WORN I PRAY YOU TO KEEP IT AS A MEMORIAL OF YOUR GALLANT BEARING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2586.wav	SO SAYING HE MOUNTED HIS STRONG WAR HORSE AND RODE OFF THROUGH THE FOREST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2587.wav	DURING ALL THIS TIME ISAAC OF YORK SAT MOURNFULLY APART GRIEVING FOR THE LOSS OF HIS DEARLY LOVED DAUGHTER REBECCA
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2588.wav	AND WITH THIS EPISTLE THE UNHAPPY OLD MAN SET OUT TO PROCURE HIS DAUGHTER'S LIBERATION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2589.wav	THE TEMPLAR IS FLED SAID DE BRACY IN ANSWER TO THE PRINCE'S EAGER QUESTIONS FRONT DE BOEUF YOU WILL NEVER SEE MORE AND HE ADDED IN A LOW AND EMPHATIC TONE RICHARD IS IN ENGLAND I HAVE SEEN HIM AND SPOKEN WITH HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2590.wav	HE APPEALED TO DE BRACY TO ASSIST HIM IN THIS PROJECT AND BECAME AT ONCE DEEPLY SUSPICIOUS OF THE KNIGHT'S LOYALTY TOWARDS HIM WHEN HE DECLINED TO LIFT HAND AGAINST THE MAN WHO HAD SPARED HIS OWN LIFE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2591.wav	BEFORE REACHING HIS DESTINATION HE WAS TOLD THAT LUCAS DE BEAUMANOIR THE GRAND MASTER OF THE ORDER OF THE TEMPLARS WAS THEN ON VISIT TO THE PRECEPTORY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2592.wav	HE HAD NOT UNTIL THEN BEEN INFORMED OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JEWISH MAIDEN IN THE ABODE OF THE TEMPLARS AND GREAT WAS HIS FURY AND INDIGNATION ON LEARNING THAT SHE WAS AMONGST THEM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2593.wav	POOR ISAAC WAS HURRIED OFF ACCORDINGLY AND EXPELLED FROM THE PRECEPTORY ALL HIS ENTREATIES AND EVEN HIS OFFERS UNHEARD AND DISREGARDED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2594.wav	THE ASSURANCE THAT SHE POSSESSED SOME FRIEND IN THIS AWFUL ASSEMBLY GAVE HER COURAGE TO LOOK AROUND AND TO MARK INTO WHOSE PRESENCE SHE HAD BEEN CONDUCTED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2595.wav	SHE GAZED ACCORDINGLY UPON A SCENE WHICH MIGHT WELL HAVE STRUCK TERROR INTO A BOLDER HEART THAN HERS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2596.wav	AT HIS FEET WAS PLACED A TABLE OCCUPIED BY TWO SCRIBES WHOSE DUTY IT WAS TO RECORD THE PROCEEDINGS OF THE DAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2597.wav	THE PRECEPTORS OF WHOM THERE WERE FOUR PRESENT OCCUPIED SEATS BEHIND THEIR SUPERIORS AND BEHIND THEM STOOD THE ESQUIRES OF THE ORDER ROBED IN WHITE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2598.wav	AND LAURA HAD HER OWN PET PLANS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2599.wav	SHE MEANT TO BE SCRUPULOUSLY CONSCIENTIOUS IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF HER TALENTS AND SOMETIMES AT CHURCH ON A SUNDAY WHEN THE SERMON WAS PARTICULARLY AWAKENING SHE MENTALLY DEBATED THE SERIOUS QUESTION AS TO WHETHER NEW BONNETS AND A PAIR OF JOUVIN'S GLOVES DAILY WERE NOT SINFUL BUT I THINK SHE DECIDED THAT THE NEW BONNETS AND GLOVES WERE ON THE WHOLE A PARDONABLE WEAKNESS AS BEING GOOD FOR TRADE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2600.wav	ONE MORNING LAURA TOLD HER HUSBAND WITH A GAY LAUGH THAT SHE WAS GOING TO VICTIMIZE HIM BUT HE WAS TO PROMISE TO BE PATIENT AND BEAR WITH HER FOR ONCE IN A WAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2601.wav	I WANT TO SEE ALL THE PICTURES THE MODERN PICTURES ESPECIALLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2602.wav	I REMEMBER ALL THE RUBENSES AT THE LOUVRE FOR I SAW THEM THREE YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS STAYING IN PARIS WITH GRANDPAPA
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2603.wav	SHE RETURNED IN A LITTLE MORE THAN TEN MINUTES IN THE FRESHEST TOILETTE ALL PALE SHIMMERING BLUE LIKE THE SPRING SKY WITH PEARL GREY GLOVES AND BOOTS AND PARASOL AND A BONNET THAT SEEMED MADE OF AZURE BUTTERFLIES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2604.wav	IT WAS DRAWING TOWARDS THE CLOSE OF THIS DELIGHTFUL HONEYMOON TOUR AND IT WAS A BRIGHT SUNSHINY MORNING EARLY IN FEBRUARY BUT FEBRUARY IN PARIS IS SOMETIMES BETTER THAN APRIL IN LONDON
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2605.wav	BUT SHE FIXED UPON A PICTURE WHICH SHE SAID SHE PREFERRED TO ANYTHING SHE HAD SEEN IN THE GALLERY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2606.wav	PHILIP JOCELYN WAS EXAMINING SOME PICTURES ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE ROOM WHEN HIS WIFE MADE THIS DISCOVERY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2607.wav	HOW I WISH YOU COULD GET ME A COPY OF THAT PICTURE PHILIP LAURA SAID ENTREATINGLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2608.wav	I SHOULD SO LIKE ONE TO HANG IN MY MORNING ROOM AT JOCELYN'S ROCK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2609.wav	SHE TURNED TO THE FRENCH ARTIST PRESENTLY AND ASKED HIM WHERE THE ELDER MISTER KERSTALL LIVED AND IF THERE WAS ANY POSSIBILITY OF SEEING HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2610.wav	THEY HAVE SAID THAT HE IS EVEN A LITTLE IMBECILE THAT HE DOES NOT REMEMBER HIMSELF OF THE MOST COMMON EVENTS OF HIS LIFE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2611.wav	BUT THERE ARE SOME OTHERS WHO SAY THAT HIS MEMORY HAS NOT ALTOGETHER FAILED AND THAT HE IS STILL ENOUGH HARSHLY CRITICAL TOWARDS THE WORKS OF OTHERS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2612.wav	I DON'T THINK YOU WILL HAVE ANY DIFFICULTY IN FINDING THE HOUSE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2613.wav	YOU WILL BE DOING ME SUCH A FAVOUR PHILIP IF YOU'LL SAY YES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2614.wav	I AM FROM THE CUTTER LYING OFF THE COAST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2615.wav	DON'T CRY HE SAID I WAS OBLIGED TO COME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2616.wav	AND AND YOU HAVE NOT FOUND OUT ANYTHING CAME IN QUICK FRIGHTENED TONES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2617.wav	I WISH YOU WOULD BELIEVE ME THAT I AM IN AS GREAT TROUBLE ABOUT IT AS YOU ARE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2618.wav	THAT MY FATHER SIR RISDON GRAEME HAS SMUGGLED GOODS HERE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2619.wav	HE COULD NOT HELP IT HE HATES THE SMUGGLERS YOU SHALL NOT TELL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2620.wav	PRAY PRAY SAY YOU WILL NOT ARCHY WAS SILENT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2621.wav	THEN AS ARCHY STOOD IN THE DARK LITERALLY AGHAST WITH ASTONISHMENT HE HEARD THE FAINT RUSTLING ONCE MORE AND AGAIN ALL WAS SILENT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2622.wav	HE LAUGHED BUT IT WAS A CURIOUS KIND OF LAUGH FULL OF VEXATION INJURED AMOUR PROPRE AS THE FRENCH CALL OUR LOVE OF OUR OWN DIGNITY OF WHICH ARCHIBALD RAYSTOKE IN THE FULL FLUSH OF HIS YOUNG BELIEF IN HIS IMPORTANCE AS A BRITISH OFFICER HAD A PRETTY GOOD STOCK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2623.wav	IT ALL COMES OF DRESSING UP IN THIS STUPID WAY LIKE A ROUGH FISHER LAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2624.wav	COLD WATER CAME ON THIS IDEA DIRECTLY AS HE RECALLED THE FACT THAT THE DARKNESS WAS INTENSE AND CELIA COULD NOT HAVE SEEN HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2625.wav	I'LL SOON SHOW THEM THAT I AM NOT GOING TO BE PLAYED WITH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2626.wav	FOR IT SUDDENLY OCCURRED TO HIM THAT HE WAS NOT ONLY A PRISONER BUT A PRISONER IN THE POWER OF A VERY RECKLESS SET OF PEOPLE WHO WOULD STOP AT NOTHING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2627.wav	NO HE THOUGHT TO HIMSELF I DON'T BELIEVE THEY WOULD KILL ME BUT THEY WOULD KNOCK ME ABOUT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2628.wav	THE KICK HE HAD RECEIVED WAS A FORETASTE OF WHAT HE MIGHT EXPECT AND AFTER A LITTLE CONSIDERATION HE CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT HIS DUTY WAS TO ESCAPE AND GET BACK TO THE CUTTER AS QUICKLY AS HE COULD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2629.wav	TO DO THIS HE MUST SCHEME LIE HID TILL MORNING THEN MAKE FOR THE NEAREST POINT AND SIGNAL FOR HELP UNLESS A BOAT'S CREW WERE ALREADY SEARCHING FOR HIM HOW TO ESCAPE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2630.wav	THE WINDOW WAS BARRED BUT HE WENT TO IT AND TRIED THE BARS ONE BY ONE TO FIND THEM ALL SOLIDLY FITTED INTO THE STONE SILL

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2633.wav	NO THAT WAS TOO BAD HE COULD NOT DO THAT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2634.wav	SYMPATHY AND PITY FOR THE DWELLERS IN THE HOZE WERE COMPLETELY GONE NOW AND HE SET HIS TEETH FAST AND MENTALLY CALLED HIMSELF A WEAK IDIOT FOR EVER THINKING ABOUT SUCH PEOPLE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2635.wav	A NARROW TABLE AGAINST THE WALL IN TWO PLACES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2636.wav	HE WENT AND TRIED TO FORCE HIS HEAD THROUGH RECALLING AS HE DID THAT WHERE A PERSON'S HEAD WOULD GO THE REST OF THE BODY WOULD PASS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2637.wav	BUT THERE WAS NO CHANCE FOR HIS BODY THERE THE HEAD WOULD NOT GO FIRST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2638.wav	A FELLOW WHO WAS SHUT UP IN PRISON FOR LIFE MIGHT DO IT HE SAID BUT NOT IN A CASE LIKE THIS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2639.wav	SURE YOU'VE LOOKED ROUND EVERYWHERE BOY YES FATHER QUITE

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2774.wav	SO SIGURD SAID THAT SWORD WOULD DO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2775.wav	THEN HE SAW THE TRACK WHICH THE DRAGON MADE WHEN HE WENT TO A CLIFF TO DRINK AND THE TRACK WAS AS IF A GREAT RIVER HAD ROLLED ALONG AND LEFT A DEEP VALLEY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2776.wav	BUT SIGURD WAITED TILL HALF OF HIM HAD CRAWLED OVER THE PIT AND THEN HE THRUST THE SWORD GRAM RIGHT INTO HIS VERY HEART
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2777.wav	SIGURD SAID I WOULD TOUCH NONE OF IT IF BY LOSING IT I SHOULD NEVER DIE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2778.wav	BUT ALL MEN DIE AND NO BRAVE MAN LETS DEATH FRIGHTEN HIM FROM HIS DESIRE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2779.wav	DIE THOU FAFNIR AND THEN FAFNIR DIED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2780.wav	THEN SIGURD RODE BACK AND MET REGIN AND REGIN ASKED HIM TO ROAST FAFNIR'S HEART AND LET HIM TASTE OF IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2781.wav	SO SIGURD PUT THE HEART OF FAFNIR ON A STAKE AND ROASTED IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2782.wav	THERE IS SIGURD ROASTING FAFNIR'S HEART FOR ANOTHER WHEN HE SHOULD TASTE OF IT HIMSELF AND LEARN ALL WISDOM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2783.wav	THAT LET HIM DO AND THEN RIDE OVER HINDFELL TO THE PLACE WHERE BRYNHILD SLEEPS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2784.wav	THERE MUST SHE SLEEP TILL THOU COMEST FOR HER WAKING RISE UP AND RIDE FOR NOW SURE SHE WILL SWEAR THE VOW FEARLESS OF BREAKING

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2786.wav	THEN SIGURD RODE AWAY AND HE CAME TO THE HOUSE OF A KING WHO HAD A FAIR DAUGHTER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2787.wav	THEN BRYNHILD'S FATHER TOLD GUNNAR THAT SHE WOULD MARRY NONE BUT HIM WHO COULD RIDE THE FLAME IN FRONT OF HER ENCHANTED TOWER AND THITHER THEY RODE AND GUNNAR SET HIS HORSE AT THE FLAME BUT HE WOULD NOT FACE IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2788.wav	FOR ONE DAY WHEN BRYNHILD AND GUDRUN WERE BATHING BRYNHILD WADED FARTHEST OUT INTO THE RIVER AND SAID SHE DID THAT TO SHOW SHE WAS GUIRUN'S SUPERIOR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2789.wav	FOR HER HUSBAND SHE SAID HAD RIDDEN THROUGH THE FLAME WHEN NO OTHER MAN DARED FACE IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2790.wav	NOT LONG TO WAIT HE SAID TILL THE BITTER SWORD STANDS FAST IN MY HEART AND THOU WILL NOT LIVE LONG WHEN I AM DEAD

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2792.wav	THE EXPENSE OF PRESERVING THEM WITH SUGAR IS A SERIOUS OBJECTION FOR EXCEPT THE SUGAR IS USED IN CONSIDERABLE QUANTITIES THE SUCCESS IS VERY UNCERTAIN

/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2800.wav	BOIL THEM UP THREE DAYS SUCCESSIVELY SKIMMING EACH TIME AND THEY WILL THEN BE FINISHED AND IN A STATE FIT TO BE PUT INTO POTS FOR USE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2801.wav	THE REASON WHY THE FRUIT IS EMPTIED OUT OF THE PRESERVING PAN INTO AN EARTHEN PAN IS THAT THE ACID OF THE FRUIT ACTS UPON THE COPPER OF WHICH THE PRESERVING PANS ARE USUALLY MADE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2802.wav	FROM THIS EXAMPLE THE PROCESS OF PRESERVING FRUITS BY SYRUP WILL BE EASILY COMPREHENDED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2803.wav	THEY SHOULD BE DRIED IN THE STOVE OR OVEN ON A SIEVE AND TURNED EVERY SIX OR EIGHT HOURS FRESH POWDERED SUGAR BEING SIFTED OVER THEM EVERY TIME THEY ARE TURNED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2804.wav	IN THIS WAY IT IS ALSO THAT ORANGE AND LEMON CHIPS ARE PRESERVED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2805.wav	MARMALADES JAMS AND FRUIT PASTES ARE OF THE SAME NATURE AND ARE NOW IN VERY GENERAL REQUEST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2806.wav	MARMALADES AND JAMS DIFFER LITTLE FROM EACH OTHER THEY ARE PRESERVES OF A HALF LIQUID CONSISTENCY MADE BY BOILING THE PULP OF FRUITS AND SOMETIMES PART OF THE RINDS WITH SUGAR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2807.wav	THAT THEY MAY KEEP IT IS NECESSARY NOT TO BE SPARING OF SUGAR FIFTEEN O THREE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2808.wav	IN ALL THE OPERATIONS FOR PRESERVE MAKING WHEN THE PRESERVING PAN IS USED IT SHOULD NOT BE PLACED ON THE FIRE BUT ON A TRIVET UNLESS THE JAM IS MADE ON A HOT PLATE WHEN THIS IS NOT NECESSARY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2809.wav	CONFECTIONARY FIFTEEN O EIGHT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2810.wav	IN SPEAKING OF CONFECTIONARY IT SHOULD BE REMARKED THAT ALL THE VARIOUS PREPARATIONS ABOVE NAMED COME STRICTLY SPEAKING UNDER THAT HEAD FOR THE VARIOUS FRUITS FLOWERS HERBS ROOTS AND JUICES WHICH WHEN BOILED WITH SUGAR WERE FORMERLY EMPLOYED IN PHARMACY AS WELL AS FOR SWEETMEATS WERE CALLED CONFECTIONS FROM THE LATIN WORD CONFICERE TO MAKE UP BUT THE TERM CONFECTIONARY EMBRACES A VERY LARGE CLASS INDEED OF SWEET FOOD MANY KINDS OF WHICH SHOULD NOT BE ATTEMPTED IN THE ORDINARY CUISINE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2811.wav	THE THOUSAND AND ONE ORNAMENTAL DISHES THAT ADORN THE TABLES OF THE WEALTHY SHOULD BE PURCHASED FROM THE CONFECTIONER THEY CANNOT PROFITABLY BE MADE AT HOME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2812.wav	HOWEVER AS LATE AS THE REIGNS OF OUR TWO LAST GEORGES FABULOUS SUMS WERE OFTEN EXPENDED UPON FANCIFUL DESSERTS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2813.wav	THE SHAPE OF THE DISHES VARIES AT DIFFERENT PERIODS THE PREVAILING FASHION AT PRESENT BEING OVAL AND CIRCULAR DISHES ON STEMS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2814.wav	ICES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2815.wav	AT DESSERTS OR AT SOME EVENING PARTIES ICES ARE SCARCELY TO BE DISPENSED WITH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2816.wav	THE SPADDLE IS GENERALLY MADE OF COPPER KEPT BRIGHT AND CLEAN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2817.wav	THEY SHOULD BE TAKEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE REPAST OR SOME HOURS AFTER BECAUSE THE TAKING THESE SUBSTANCES DURING THE PROCESS OF DIGESTION IS APT TO PROVOKE INDISPOSITION
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2818.wav	WILT THOU SERVE ME AND WATCH MY SEVEN FOALS ASKED THE KING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2819.wav	THE YOUTH THOUGHT THAT IT WAS VERY EASY WORK TO WATCH THE FOALS AND THAT HE COULD DO IT WELL ENOUGH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2820.wav	HAST THOU WATCHED FAITHFULLY AND WELL THE WHOLE DAY LONG SAID THE KING WHEN THE LAD CAME INTO HIS PRESENCE IN THE EVENING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2821.wav	YES THAT I HAVE SAID THE YOUTH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2822.wav	HE HAD GONE OUT ONCE TO SEEK A PLACE HE SAID BUT NEVER WOULD HE DO SUCH A THING AGAIN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2823.wav	THEN THE KING PROMISED HIM THE SAME PUNISHMENT AND THE SAME REWARD THAT HE HAD PROMISED HIS BROTHER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2824.wav	WHEN HE HAD RUN AFTER THE FOALS FOR A LONG LONG TIME AND WAS HOT AND TIRED HE PASSED BY A CLEFT IN THE ROCK WHERE AN OLD WOMAN WAS SITTING SPINNING WITH A DISTAFF AND SHE CALLED TO HIM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2825.wav	COME HITHER COME HITHER MY HANDSOME SON AND LET ME COMB YOUR HAIR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2826.wav	THE YOUTH LIKED THE THOUGHT OF THIS LET THE FOALS RUN WHERE THEY CHOSE AND SEATED HIMSELF IN THE CLEFT OF THE ROCK BY THE SIDE OF THE OLD HAG
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2827.wav	SO THERE HE SAT WITH HIS HEAD ON HER LAP TAKING HIS EASE THE LIVELONG DAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2828.wav	ON THE THIRD DAY CINDERLAD WANTED TO SET OUT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2829.wav	THE TWO BROTHERS LAUGHED AT HIM AND HIS FATHER AND MOTHER BEGGED HIM NOT TO GO BUT ALL TO NO PURPOSE AND CINDERLAD SET OUT ON HIS WAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2830.wav	I AM WALKING ABOUT IN SEARCH OF A PLACE SAID CINDERLAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2831.wav	I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE THE PRINCESS SAID CINDERLAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2832.wav	AND THUS THEY JOURNEYED ONWARDS A LONG LONG WAY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2833.wav	WHEN THEY HAD GONE THUS FOR A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL AGAIN ASKED DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2834.wav	YES NOW I SEE SOMETHING THAT IS WHITE SAID CINDERLAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2835.wav	IT LOOKS LIKE THE TRUNK OF A GREAT THICK BIRCH TREE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2836.wav	CINDERLAD TRIED BUT COULD NOT DO IT SO HE HAD TO TAKE A DRAUGHT FROM THE PITCHER AND THEN ONE MORE AND AFTER THAT STILL ANOTHER AND THEN HE WAS ABLE TO WIELD THE SWORD WITH PERFECT EASE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2837.wav	FOR WE ARE BROTHERS OF THE PRINCESS WHOM THOU ART TO HAVE WHEN THOU CANST TELL THE KING WHAT WE EAT AND DRINK BUT THERE IS A MIGHTY TROLL WHO HAS CAST A SPELL OVER US
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2838.wav	WHEN THEY HAD TRAVELLED A LONG LONG WAY THE FOAL SAID DOST THOU SEE ANYTHING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2839.wav	AND NOW INQUIRED THE FOAL SEEST THOU NOTHING NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2840.wav	NOW THEN SAID THE FOAL DOST THOU NOT SEE ANYTHING NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2841.wav	THAT IS A RIVER SAID THE FOAL AND WE HAVE TO CROSS IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2842.wav	I HAVE DONE MY BEST REPLIED CINDERLAD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2843.wav	THERE'S IRON THEY SAY IN ALL OUR BLOOD AND A GRAIN OR TWO PERHAPS IS GOOD BUT HIS HE MAKES ME HARSHLY FEEL HAS GOT A LITTLE TOO MUCH OF STEEL ANON
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2844.wav	MARGARET SAID MISTER HALE AS HE RETURNED FROM SHOWING HIS GUEST DOWNSTAIRS I COULD NOT HELP WATCHING YOUR FACE WITH SOME ANXIETY WHEN MISTER THORNTON MADE HIS CONFESSION OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2845.wav	YOU DON'T MEAN THAT YOU THOUGHT ME SO SILLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2846.wav	I REALLY LIKED THAT ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF BETTER THAN ANYTHING ELSE HE SAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2847.wav	HIS STATEMENT OF HAVING BEEN A SHOP BOY WAS THE THING I LIKED BEST OF ALL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2848.wav	YOU WHO WERE ALWAYS ACCUSING PEOPLE OF BEING SHOPPY AT HELSTONE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2849.wav	I DON'T THINK MISTER HALE YOU HAVE DONE QUITE RIGHT IN INTRODUCING SUCH A PERSON TO US WITHOUT TELLING US WHAT HE HAD BEEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2850.wav	I REALLY WAS VERY MUCH AFRAID OF SHOWING HIM HOW MUCH SHOCKED I WAS AT SOME PARTS OF WHAT HE SAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2851.wav	HIS FATHER DYING IN MISERABLE CIRCUMSTANCES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2852.wav	WHY IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THE WORKHOUSE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2853.wav	HIS FATHER SPECULATED WILDLY FAILED AND THEN KILLED HIMSELF BECAUSE HE COULD NOT BEAR THE DISGRACE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2854.wav	ALL HIS FORMER FRIENDS SHRUNK FROM THE DISCLOSURES THAT HAD TO BE MADE OF HIS DISHONEST GAMBLING WILD HOPELESS STRUGGLES MADE WITH OTHER PEOPLE'S MONEY TO REGAIN HIS OWN MODERATE PORTION OF WEALTH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2855.wav	NO ONE CAME FORWARDS TO HELP THE MOTHER AND THIS BOY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2856.wav	AT LEAST NO FRIEND CAME FORWARDS IMMEDIATELY AND MISSUS THORNTON IS NOT ONE I FANCY TO WAIT TILL TARDY KINDNESS COMES TO FIND HER OUT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2857.wav	SO THEY LEFT MILTON
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2858.wav	HOW TAINTED ASKED HER FATHER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2859.wav	OH PAPA BY THAT TESTING EVERYTHING BY THE STANDARD OF WEALTH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2860.wav	WHEN HE SPOKE OF THE MECHANICAL POWERS HE EVIDENTLY LOOKED UPON THEM ONLY AS NEW WAYS OF EXTENDING TRADE AND MAKING MONEY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2861.wav	AND THE POOR MEN AROUND HIM THEY WERE POOR BECAUSE THEY WERE VICIOUS OUT OF THE PALE OF HIS SYMPATHIES BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT HIS IRON NATURE AND THE CAPABILITIES THAT IT GIVES HIM FOR BEING RICH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2862.wav	NOT VICIOUS HE NEVER SAID THAT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2863.wav	IMPROVIDENT AND SELF INDULGENT WERE HIS WORDS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2864.wav	MARGARET WAS COLLECTING HER MOTHER'S WORKING MATERIALS AND PREPARING TO GO TO BED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2865.wav	JUST AS SHE WAS LEAVING THE ROOM SHE HESITATED SHE WAS INCLINED TO MAKE AN ACKNOWLEDGMENT WHICH SHE THOUGHT WOULD PLEASE HER FATHER BUT WHICH TO BE FULL AND TRUE MUST INCLUDE A LITTLE ANNOYANCE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2866.wav	HOWEVER OUT IT CAME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2867.wav	PAPA I DO THINK MISTER THORNTON A VERY REMARKABLE MAN BUT PERSONALLY I DON'T LIKE HIM AT ALL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2868.wav	AND I DO SAID HER FATHER LAUGHING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2869.wav	PERSONALLY AS YOU CALL IT AND ALL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2870.wav	I DON'T SET HIM UP FOR A HERO OR ANYTHING OF THAT KIND
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2871.wav	BUT GOOD NIGHT CHILD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2872.wav	THERE WERE SEVERAL OTHER SIGNS OF SOMETHING WRONG ABOUT MISSUS HALE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2873.wav	SHE AND DIXON HELD MYSTERIOUS CONSULTATIONS IN HER BEDROOM FROM WHICH DIXON WOULD COME OUT CRYING AND CROSS AS WAS HER CUSTOM WHEN ANY DISTRESS OF HER MISTRESS CALLED UPON HER SYMPATHY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2874.wav	ONCE MARGARET HAD GONE INTO THE CHAMBER SOON AFTER DIXON LEFT IT AND FOUND HER MOTHER ON HER KNEES AND AS MARGARET STOLE OUT SHE CAUGHT A FEW WORDS WHICH WERE EVIDENTLY A PRAYER FOR STRENGTH AND PATIENCE TO ENDURE SEVERE BODILY SUFFERING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2875.wav	BUT THOUGH SHE RECEIVED CARESSES AND FOND WORDS BACK AGAIN IN SUCH PROFUSION AS WOULD HAVE GLADDENED HER FORMERLY YET SHE FELT THAT THERE WAS A SECRET WITHHELD FROM HER AND SHE BELIEVED IT BORE SERIOUS REFERENCE TO HER MOTHER'S HEALTH
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2876.wav	SHE LAY AWAKE VERY LONG THIS NIGHT PLANNING HOW TO LESSEN THE EVIL INFLUENCE OF THEIR MILTON LIFE ON HER MOTHER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2877.wav	A SERVANT TO GIVE DIXON PERMANENT ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE GOT IF SHE GAVE UP HER WHOLE TIME TO THE SEARCH AND THEN AT ANY RATE HER MOTHER MIGHT HAVE ALL THE PERSONAL ATTENTION SHE REQUIRED AND HAD BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO HER WHOLE LIFE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2878.wav	VISITING REGISTER OFFICES SEEING ALL MANNER OF UNLIKELY PEOPLE AND VERY FEW IN THE LEAST LIKELY ABSORBED MARGARET'S TIME AND THOUGHTS FOR SEVERAL DAYS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2879.wav	ONE AFTERNOON SHE MET BESSY HIGGINS IN THE STREET AND STOPPED TO SPEAK TO HER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2880.wav	WELL BESSY HOW ARE YOU
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2881.wav	BETTER AND NOT BETTER IF YO KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2882.wav	NOT EXACTLY REPLIED MARGARET SMILING
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2883.wav	I'M BETTER IN NOT BEING TORN TO PIECES BY COUGHING O'NIGHTS BUT I'M WEARY AND TIRED O MILTON AND LONGING TO GET AWAY TO THE LAND O BEULAH AND WHEN I THINK I'M FARTHER AND FARTHER OFF MY HEART SINKS AND I'M NO BETTER I'M WORSE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2884.wav	MARGARET TURNED ROUND TO WALK ALONGSIDE OF THE GIRL IN HER FEEBLE PROGRESS HOMEWARD
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2885.wav	BUT FOR A MINUTE OR TWO SHE DID NOT SPEAK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2886.wav	AT LAST SHE SAID IN A LOW VOICE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2887.wav	BESSY DO YOU WISH TO DIE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2888.wav	BESSY WAS SILENT IN HER TURN FOR A MINUTE OR TWO THEN SHE REPLIED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2889.wav	NOUGHT WORSE THAN MANY OTHERS I RECKON
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2890.wav	BUT WHAT WAS IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2891.wav	YOU KNOW I'M A STRANGER HERE SO PERHAPS I'M NOT SO QUICK AT UNDERSTANDING WHAT YOU MEAN AS IF I'D LIVED ALL MY LIFE AT MILTON
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2892.wav	I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT I SAID FOR THE TIME CONTINUED MARGARET QUIETLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2893.wav	I SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT OF IT AGAIN WHEN I WAS LESS BUSY MAY I GO WITH YOU NOW
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2894.wav	THE SHARPNESS IN HER EYE TURNED TO A WISTFUL LONGING AS SHE MET MARGARET'S SOFT AND FRIENDLY GAZE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2895.wav	AS THEY TURNED UP INTO A SMALL COURT OPENING OUT OF A SQUALID STREET BESSY SAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2896.wav	YO'LL NOT BE DAUNTED IF FATHER'S AT HOME AND SPEAKS A BIT GRUFFISH AT FIRST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2897.wav	BUT NICHOLAS WAS NOT AT HOME WHEN THEY ENTERED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2898.wav	GASPED BESSY AT LAST
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2899.wav	BESSY TOOK A LONG AND FEVERISH DRAUGHT AND THEN FELL BACK AND SHUT HER EYES
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2900.wav	MARGARET BENT OVER AND SAID BESSY DON'T BE IMPATIENT WITH YOUR LIFE WHATEVER IT IS OR MAY HAVE BEEN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2901.wav	REMEMBER WHO GAVE IT YOU AND MADE IT WHAT IT IS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2902.wav	NOW I'LL NOT HAVE MY WENCH PREACHED TO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2903.wav	BUT SURELY SAID MARGARET FACING ROUND YOU BELIEVE IN WHAT I SAID THAT GOD GAVE HER LIFE AND ORDERED WHAT KIND OF LIFE IT WAS TO BE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2904.wav	I BELIEVE WHAT I SEE AND NO MORE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2905.wav	THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE YOUNG WOMAN
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2906.wav	I DON'T BELIEVE ALL I HEAR NO NOT BY A BIG DEAL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2907.wav	BUT HOO'S COME AT LAST AND HOO'S WELCOME AS LONG AS HOO'LL KEEP FROM PREACHING ON WHAT HOO KNOWS NOUGHT ABOUT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2908.wav	IT'S SIMPLE AND NOT FAR TO FETCH NOR HARD TO WORK
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2909.wav	BUT THE GIRL ONLY PLEADED THE MORE WITH MARGARET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2910.wav	DON'T THINK HARDLY ON HIM HE'S A GOOD MAN HE IS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2911.wav	I SOMETIMES THINK I SHALL BE MOPED WI SORROW EVEN IN THE CITY OF GOD IF FATHER IS NOT THERE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2912.wav	THE FEVERISH COLOUR CAME INTO HER CHEEK AND THE FEVERISH FLAME INTO HER EYE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2913.wav	BUT YOU WILL BE THERE FATHER YOU SHALL OH MY HEART
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2914.wav	SHE PUT HER HAND TO IT AND BECAME GHASTLY PALE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2915.wav	MARGARET HELD HER IN HER ARMS AND PUT THE WEARY HEAD TO REST UPON HER BOSOM
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2916.wav	PRESENTLY THE SPASM THAT FORESHADOWED DEATH HAD PASSED AWAY AND BESSY ROUSED HERSELF AND SAID
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2917.wav	I'LL GO TO BED IT'S BEST PLACE BUT CATCHING AT MARGARET'S GOWN YO'LL COME AGAIN I KNOW YO WILL BUT JUST SAY IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2918.wav	I WILL COME TO MORROW SAID MARGARET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2919.wav	MARGARET WENT AWAY VERY SAD AND THOUGHTFUL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2920.wav	SHE WAS LATE FOR TEA AT HOME
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2921.wav	HAVE YOU MET WITH A SERVANT DEAR
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2922.wav	NO MAMMA THAT ANNE BUCKLEY WOULD NEVER HAVE DONE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2923.wav	SUPPOSE I TRY SAID MISTER HALE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2924.wav	EVERYBODY ELSE HAS HAD THEIR TURN AT THIS GREAT DIFFICULTY NOW LET ME TRY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2925.wav	I MAY BE THE CINDERELLA TO PUT ON THE SLIPPER AFTER ALL
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2926.wav	WHAT WOULD YOU DO PAPA HOW WOULD YOU SET ABOUT IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2927.wav	WHY I WOULD APPLY TO SOME GOOD HOUSE MOTHER TO RECOMMEND ME ONE KNOWN TO HERSELF OR HER SERVANTS
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2928.wav	VERY GOOD BUT WE MUST FIRST CATCH OUR HOUSE MOTHER
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2929.wav	THE MOTHER OF WHOM HE SPOKE TO US SAID MARGARET
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2930.wav	MISSUS THORNTON THE ONLY MOTHER HE HAS I BELIEVE SAID MISTER HALE QUIETLY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2931.wav	I SHALL LIKE TO SEE HER SHE MUST BE AN UNCOMMON PERSON HER MOTHER ADDED
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2932.wav	PERHAPS SHE MAY HAVE A RELATION WHO MIGHT SUIT US AND BE GLAD OF OUR PLACE
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2933.wav	SHE SOUNDED TO BE SUCH A CAREFUL ECONOMICAL PERSON THAT I SHOULD LIKE ANY ONE OUT OF THE SAME FAMILY
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2934.wav	MY DEAR SAID MISTER HALE ALARMED PRAY DON'T GO OFF ON THAT IDEA
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2935.wav	I AM SURE AT ANY RATE SHE WOULD NOT LIKE STRANGERS TO KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2936.wav	TAKE NOTICE THAT IS NOT MY KIND OF HAUGHTINESS PAPA IF I HAVE ANY AT ALL WHICH I DON'T AGREE TO THOUGH YOU'RE ALWAYS ACCUSING ME OF IT
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2937.wav	I DON'T KNOW POSITIVELY THAT IT IS HERS EITHER BUT FROM LITTLE THINGS I HAVE GATHERED FROM HIM I FANCY SO
/home/luis/Desktop/librispeech_testOthers_azure/2938.wav	THEY CARED TOO LITTLE TO ASK IN WHAT MANNER HER SON HAD SPOKEN ABOUT HER
