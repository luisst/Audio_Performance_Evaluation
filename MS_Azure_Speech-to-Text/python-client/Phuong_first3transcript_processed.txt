	1 (0.67): Enter.
	1 (0.00): Deeper.
	1 (0.15): And there is an OK.
	1 (0.02): Give
	1 (0.01): camera.
	1 (0.02): Cortana.
	1 (0.02): 11
	1 (0.58): center
	1 (0.04): multiplication
	1 (0.10): yeah.
	1 (0.33): Those.
	1 (0.26): They they're.
	1 (0.44): So the first line is wow.
	1 (0.28): So they show you.
	1 (0.44): So yeah.
	1 (0.14): Get a thermometer.
	1 (0.12): Or
	1 (0.22): there are.
	1 (0.51): OK, now let me know.
	1 (0.05): Hello.
	1 (0.74): Can you see?
	1 (0.03): Question.
	1 (0.24): Says ABC
	1 (0.35): what are these?
	1 (0.54): Play the game.
	1 (0.64): We're already playing you already playing it, but you know what's going on inside.
	1 (0.02): Hello.
	1 (0.62): Practically, what's going on inside is that, like here, are all the codes that are starting the game, so everything that is right here is like starting the game. So like you could see right here, it has translated to like you.
	1 (0.88): So like we could also change it.
	1 (0.44): So let me ask you something.
	1 (0.26): We're getting.
	1 (0.75): So what does this mean? The first line it's asking for?
	1 (0.71): You're asking for your name. It says what is your name, right? So when we run this?
	1 (0.65): OK OK, can you say what is your name Joe Johanna? So where did that come from? Though it came from the first quarter.
	1 (0.26): Remember what we actually know?
	1 (0.05): Alright, so anyway.
	1 (0.14): So we're running this anymore.
	1 (0.70): Where did where did they get this?
	1 (0.50): They got it.
	1 (0.77): When did she type it in?
	1 (0.23): Thanks.
	1 (0.85): It was before you guys did that before.
	1 (0.16): Brothers and so.
	1 (0.70): I'm going to restart the kernel and it's still saving the.
	1 (0.02): 1.
	1 (0.77): Alright, so what's happening is say, what is your name and then it gives you the box, right? Yeah, so why do you think it gives you the box of to type? Where in the code do you think it gives you the box to type, you know?
	1 (0.62): OK, well you haven't watched it.
	1 (0.35): Can you use the mouse look at the postal number?
	1 (0.71): This whole thing is the code. This whole thing make this whole thing works. OK so go up all the way.
	1 (0.20): That you compose as a process. So it's looking that look.
	1 (0.69): No. So the first of all it print out. What is your name right? So where does that come from? Where do you think which line makes it print out the word? What is your name?
	1 (0.38): Burnt uh which line?
	1 (0.42): So you know this.
	1 (0.62): What number what? There's a line number?
	1 (0.22): Name print out.
	1 (0.46): What do you think that make it so?
	1 (0.62): Because the box let you type right now when you say Hola.
	1 (0.68): And I love you, Chris.
	1 (0.18): Tomato.
	1 (0.16): ,
	1 (0.12): empty.
	1 (0.42): You see it. You see it OK, let you take this one that you said that so the Hindu.
	1 (0.59): The comment is still on the line 1 less.
	1 (0.70): Where do you think that it let you put the type in so?
	1 (0.40): Yes, thank you.
	1 (0.68): Offline
	1 (0.41): but what word let you type?
	1 (0.25): OK, thank you.
	1 (0.58): I would just say if you delete this input type key you see what happened.
	1 (0.32): Infant is quite famous, but.
	1 (0.67): I think.
	1 (0.80): What did she say?
	1 (0.40): OK so anyway so.
	1 (0.38): Pull out with this and get better.
	1 (0.30): Yes.
	1 (0.65): OK, So what happened? So he don't have a phone, she's OK, but she only speaks in Spanish and he's yeah.
	1 (0.71): Alright, so can you ask them? Can you ask them? See he deleted the word input OK and now he run it.
	1 (0.61): And then nothing printed.
	1 (0.19): I need that and also.
	1 (0.01): Guitar.
	1 (0.10): He also runs NASA.
	1 (0.68): Allow you to type anything right? But why didn't it print out? What is your name?
	1 (0.39): Could I have a command?
	1 (0.62): If you want to know input, let you type right, you get it out so you don't. It doesn't type anymore, but.
	1 (0.78): Why doesn't it print?
	1 (0.68): Thank you, you're right. You're on the right track. It's missing a command. What command?
	1 (0.32): If you want something.
	1 (0.74): The one that she.
	1 (0.51): Color.
	1 (0.43): They were.
	1 (0.34): So I'll come in and input.
	1 (0.42): Print and input. These are right, So what do you think you need to to just show you what to get? Show that.
	1 (0.57): It's right here.
	1 (0.08): Disable.
	1 (0.71): You type print here, see what happens. OK, what happened? So she said that she thinks it's because of the input uh-huh doesn't it deleted? It wasn't able to.
	1 (0.81): So what does input do, you know?
	1 (0.27): I say implant.
	1 (0.28): Come on input export Nelo.
	1 (0.48): If I put input back.
	1 (0.06): Entertainment.
	1 (0.28): Come on, let's just.
	1 (0.04): Correct?
	1 (0.08): Another
	1 (0.60): why are you? I have to restart kernel every time. No, actually I want to leave that you may be better if you put the laptop over there because it's kind of like in the middle of everything organized.
	1 (0.41): You see, you see what happened, sorry.
	1 (0.52): See what happens. So like I just want them to mess with the codes right Mm-hmm so we deleted the input and then the the. What is your name disappeared in printing here? Is it means that it's loading it's running so leave me a message.
	1 (0.29): Our policy is literally to hire as many.
	1 (0.68): OK, what do you want the laptop to be order maybe?
	1 (0.63): If you move.
	1 (0.53): Well, you can get us here, here, here. OK, let me organize this because it's too messy.
	1 (0.65): You see, I see right.
	1 (0.65): I don't know him.
	1 (0.25): Really, yeah really. Yeah Are you sure?
	1 (0.71): Do we have to set up?
	1 (0.68): So if it's if it shows like this, it means that it's loading, so it's still running. Yeah, but actually I think you run the whole thing. It's the start of the kernel.
	1 (0.55): Yeah, I mean, it's kind of weird. I don't know why restart and clear output wait.
	1 (0.20): Kernel start.
	1 (0.62): Alright, you know, I think it's.
	1 (0.57): It's just.
	1 (0.74): Sorry, thank you for moving my mouse.
	1 (0.23): 4 isn't funny.
	1 (0.03): So.
	1 (0.79): So I think first we need. You should explain to them what are the different colors and then this is important. What does that? What is this? You know what? This right? Yeah, OK, go ahead so they know before they even like start the code.
	1 (0.00): Looking.
	1 (0.16): So significant.
	1 (0.05): Lucky is SK and.
	1 (0.00): SNK, second.
	1 (0.37): Man, that's good.
	1 (0.14): Go to school.
	1 (0.14): Sticking around.
	1 (0.56): That's all.
	1 (0.61): Are you waiting for three days? What word do you need?
	1 (0.39): Questions.
	1 (0.25): Hashtag
	1 (0.61): and so on.
	1 (0.67): So, but it's not just question though. If you put a hashtag, what does that do?
	1 (0.49): What is it called? There's an output.
	1 (0.36): Start with.
	1 (0.33): But some command what does that? What does come in do so and command is not OK.
	1 (0.64): Yeah, so I said command with command. So does it affect the code?
	1 (0.74): Alright, so commands like commands is for you guys, not for the computer it you use it to like say OK I wanna know what this line do right? If you just put it like this and you're not used to coding, it's hard for you to understand what it does right? So one way to help you is to put a hashtag what the hashtag hashtag does is that you can type whatever and it won't. It won't affect us. So you can say OK, this line does this.
	1 (0.75): It's for your own good. Like for your notes, OK, but if you get rid of the hashtag and type like this line does this this this this you run it, the computer will read that, but it doesn't understand right? Because it's not a command, so it's gonna give you error.
	1 (0.28): So yeah, I guess it's the command not not affect that I love.
	1 (0.08): Coding.
	1 (0.60): The hashtag.
	1 (0.02): Hashtag
	1 (0.11): England kinda?
	1 (0.38): I suppose I eat.
	1 (0.34): Love.
	1 (0.23): Well, yeah.
	1 (0.11): 35
	1 (0.58): and then she explained to you, right, what is what is the red? What is that it's?
	1 (0.06): What?
	1 (0.55): What do you want the computer to do like this?
	1 (0.18): Just to say.
	1 (0.72): OK, so if you if if you take out the quote, what do you think is gonna be? So first of all let me just comment all of this out. OK comment it out means the computer won't read it won't care right? Because command is for you. So if I commend this out so it doesn't run the whole thing, how do I command this?
	1 (0.27): Edit.
	1 (0.79): So if you want to commend the whole block so this hashtag only come in one one line, OK, you remember what is the code to commend the whole block?
	1 (0.18): It was.
	1 (0.01): Choice.
	1 (0.47): OK, and I want to maximize. Are you sure?
	1 (0.74): So if you put three quote, it gonna come in the whole thing. See now it's all red. OK so then the computer only read this line, the rest it doesn't care because those are comments OK?
	1 (0.11): Physical.
	1 (0.43): It's pretty good.
	1 (0.42): OK, yeah.
	1 (0.77): We only want to see what this does. We don't care about the rest yet.
	1 (0.68): Have a look.
	1 (0.23): A restaurant.
	1 (0.71): So then now you say that this one is to tell the computer what it what to do, right?
	1 (0.72): What to say? OK, so if I take the poll out, wait, let's run this real quick, go ahead and run it.
	1 (0.87): OK, so.

G-C3L1P-May04-C-Phuong_q2_01-08.wav
	1 (0.88): How do you say what did you have so far?
	1 (0.27): I'm done.
	1 (0.29): The computer.
	1 (0.11): OK.
	1 (0.46): This is the.
	1 (0.11): No.
	1 (0.18): OK.
	1 (0.01): Well.
	1 (0.07): Right?
	1 (0.03): Directly.
	1 (0.64): So you're here, right?
	1 (0.51): There's.
	1 (0.37): Progressive directly goes out.
	1 (0.33): Like
	1 (0.63): yeah.
	1 (0.55): That's great.
	1 (0.07): Background.
	1 (0.10): Yeah.
	1 (0.36): Yeah, so that's.
	1 (0.55): I don't want to draw a line here because I cannot draw.
	1 (0.59): What we did was like.
	1 (0.71): Yeah.
	1 (0.61): Do you know the name of the?
	1 (0.47): There's.
	1 (0.67): Thank you.
	1 (0.62): The red part is OK. You see, there's a spaceship here, so.
	1 (0.51): Ready for this?
	1 (0.20): B.
	1 (0.19): Yeah, actually.
	1 (0.76): That's the best one you know. They can run themselves.
	1 (0.25): Yeah.
	1 (0.83): I don't think.
	1 (0.75): You can start recording on my laptop, right?
	1 (0.28): Once.
	1 (0.75): Tell him.
	1 (0.60): So you will change the date.
	1 (0.68): I think that.
	1 (0.87): Is this trash I can take care of it?
	1 (0.66): Yeah, yeah.
	1 (0.65): You're not gonna.
	1 (0.64): Right, yeah?
	1 (0.37): Tell him to like.
	1 (0.06): OK.
	1 (0.47): They look NFL.
	1 (0.29): For that.
	1 (0.09): Memory.
	1 (0.22): 3.
	1 (0.01): Gears.
	1 (0.34): It will influence the case.
	1 (0.53): Back from you.
	1 (0.46): They got up here.
	1 (0.13): Terrible.
	1 (0.06): Equals.
	1 (0.74): Put it in.
	1 (0.65): Yeah.
	1 (0.17): Alright.
	1 (0.55): No, I can't.
	1 (0.72): Are we going to?
	1 (0.03): Ending.
	1 (0.52): Do you?
	1 (0.64): As long as you put the comments.
	1 (0.53): What?
	1 (0.33): Since it already.
	1 (0.24): Listen.
	1 (0.08): Exactly.
	1 (0.06): Really.
	1 (0.68): Like that?
	1 (0.55): OK, what's next?
	1 (0.66): Is that you can draw whatever.
	1 (0.72): If you draw.
	1 (0.47): You got this.
	1 (0.66): I haven't seen her yet.
	1 (0.82): I'm sorry I didn't.
	1 (0.64): All set back.
	1 (0.78): Alright, can I watch?
	1 (0.39): What's the number?
	1 (0.59): Yeah.
	1 (0.73): On the next screen.
	1 (0.68): Same to you.
	1 (0.01): Oh
	1 (0.69): you know you may want to change this.
	1 (0.54): No we don't.
	1 (0.39): Good good good.
	1 (0.01): Goodbye.
	1 (0.59): You can copy.
	1 (0.37): Working on his phone.
	1 (0.56): Is right now the coordinates of what he needs to do?
	1 (0.62): That I forget.
	1 (0.66): He has this one right here.
	1 (0.72): We need like this like the blue we need to make the blue but you only make this.
	1 (0.37): So which dog?
	1 (0.29): Black
	1 (0.73): so what's the blue thing?
	1 (0.48): Excuse me
	1 (0.76): we need to.
	1 (0.49): OK, I mean he said that it's not recording the whole thing.
	1 (0.23): Microphone.
	1 (0.56): What's the time?
	1 (0.32): Right?
	1 (0.71): Let me get your what you guys already have.
	1 (0.61): What's the saddest coming? What color do you think of when you're sad?
	1 (0.09): Hello.
	1 (0.39): Blue in our class like what toes are like.
	1 (0.31): Used to emphasize like sadness or.
	1 (0.21): Melancholy, hilly
	1 (0.37): Blues clues and grace.
	1 (0.15): Yeah.
	1 (0.34): Lesson.
	1 (0.88): Do you know why?
	1 (0.75): I'd like to.
	1 (0.41): That one.
	1 (0.49): Right?
	1 (0.72): The voice.
	1 (0.22): See.
	1 (0.50): We can start coding.
	1 (0.46): After you die.
	1 (0.50): Was the father.
	1 (0.05): Associated
	1 (0.72): every 10 seconds.
	1 (0.27): It just.
	1 (0.71): We had four.
	1 (0.73): Do you know how to control?
	1 (0.55): So every 5 seconds.
	1 (0.82): After you type.
	1 (0.55): After you've finished typing something so just, that's like now my finger just do it automatically.
	1 (0.39): But what this does?
	1 (0.71): The whole grain, and then you want to paint the particular grids here, right? So for the particular number of rows and columns in this one.
	1 (0.20): Yeah.
	1 (0.79): Right?
	1 (0.70): What about you?
	1 (0.33): So much.
	1 (0.62): What is the 1st?
	1 (0.51): Now you should fill the frame zero with your characters.
	1 (0.38): From here.
	1 (0.47): This guy's background is where the for the whole rows and columns we filled in like cooking and then we copied that back background to the friendship. So your frame 0.
	1 (0.64): The whole thing is light Gray. Now everything and then you want to go on top and you're going to draw either the dog dog one dog, two in the calendar. You can just create the characters now. So this one I image fill should change this to frame 0.
	1 (0.67): You need to know where your dog is, so let me just give you.
	1 (0.09): Yeah.
	1 (0.37): This is for four hours purposes.
	1 (0.52): So I always put comments and know what I'm making so it's OK.
	1 (0.66): You too.
	1 (0.70): If I want to make sure.
	1 (0.51): This one was the two and four. That means all of the work.
	1 (0.43): Column and the yeah you just need to touch it.
	1 (0.54): Start rolling and if I only want this one.
	1 (0.00): Ohhh.
	1 (0.68): What is the?
	1 (0.84): What is on Skype?
	1 (0.21): Roy.
	1 (0.27): We're moving.
	1 (0.84): Are you?
	1 (0.29): Yeah.
	1 (0.65): Since I only want to draw this road right, there's only one road, right?
	1 (0.44): Start one row one.
	1 (0.61): OK, we need Spanish.
	1 (0.72): You want.
	1 (0.52): What about the column? What column do I start?
	1 (0.58): What color will it?
	1 (0.25): Yeah.
	1 (0.74): What is the color?
	1 (0.65): No, wait.
	1 (0.63): I'm writing.
	1 (0.82): So you need to go back and see.
	1 (0.78): Use the English.
	1 (0.51): And just focus.
	1 (0.51): And focus on the code.
	1 (0.28): Then
	1 (0.07): town.
	1 (0.76): Anyway.
	1 (0.84): Go over there.
	1 (0.55): Since we need one line to line 346786 times.
	1 (0.38): Yeah, and then.
	1 (0.72): You should know which part.
	1 (0.59): Just put them in.
	1 (0.39): What column do you start?
	1 (0.02): Simulation.
	1 (0.16): Video.
	1 (0.04): Simulation.
	1 (0.28): So we finished off.
	1 (0.59): Did you say please?
	1 (0.10): It's wonderful.
	1 (0.44): So you put comments.
	1 (0.25): So we'll finish this one.
	1 (0.66): Now you're going.
	1 (0.74): How many?
	1 (0.23): Oh my God.
	1 (0.40): Don't talk to me.
	1 (0.11): 13,
	1 (0.15): 13,
	1 (0.86): are you?
	1 (0.74): I have no more.
	1 (0.59): 09
	1 (0.63): better be better than.
	1 (0.47): 4 lines.
	1 (0.69): Yes.
