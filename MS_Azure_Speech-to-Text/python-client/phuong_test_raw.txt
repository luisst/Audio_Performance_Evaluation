and then it's going ok these are all right that's why i don't judge can you explain to her what you just did champions good let me connect master so i mean that's better god champions granny yeah yeah ok champion yeah solar ok nothing ok i so you want harry tomorrow yeah all your names start with j ok so what are we doing so i'm not scared so and significant better no serial port ok already done so do you understand her 100% wait wait wait ok ok so anna we're gonna so ok escape it is in the governor's office and how do we show those codes comma they say we cannot stop hey princess ok so i give you hope quest number you're asking me to number so i got a keyboard yes give me the number now it's because we didn't connect the flash yeah enter deeper and there is an ok give camera cortana 11 center multiplication yeah those they they're so the first line is wow so they show you so yeah get a thermometer or there are ok now let me know hello can you see question says abc what are these play the game we're already playing you already playing it but you know what's going on inside hello practically what's going on inside is that like here are all the codes that are starting the game so everything that is right here is like starting the game so like you could see right here it has translated to like you so like we could also change it so let me ask you something we're getting so what does this mean the first line it's asking for you're asking for your name it says what is your name right so when we run this ok ok can you say what is your name joe johanna so where did that come from though it came from the first quarter remember what we actually know alright so anyway so we're running this anymore where did where did they get this they got it when did she type it in thanks it was before you guys did that before brothers and so i'm going to restart the kernel and it's still saving the 1 alright so what's happening is say what is your name and then it gives you the box right yeah so why do you think it gives you the box of to type where in the code do you think it gives you the box to type you know ok well you haven't watched it can you use the mouse look at the postal number this whole thing is the code this whole thing make this whole thing works ok so go up all the way that you compose as a process so it's looking that look no so the first of all it print out what is your name right so where does that come from where do you think which line makes it print out the word what is your name burnt uh which line so you know this what number what there's a line number name print out what do you think that make it so because the box let you type right now when you say hola and i love you chris tomato comma empty you see it you see it ok let you take this one that you said that so the hindu the comment is still on the line 1 less where do you think that it let you put the type in so yes thank you offline but what word let you type ok thank you i would just say if you delete this input type key you see what happened infant is quite famous but i think what did she say ok so anyway so pull out with this and get better yes ok so what happened so he don't have a phone she's ok but she only speaks in spanish and he's yeah alright so can you ask them can you ask them see he deleted the word input ok and now he run it and then nothing printed i need that and also guitar he also runs nasa allow you to type anything right but why didn't it print out what is your name could i have a command if you want to know input let you type right you get it out so you don't it doesn't type anymore but why doesn't it print thank you you're right you're on the right track it's missing a command what command if you want something the one that she color they were so i'll come in and input print and input these are right so what do you think you need to to just show you what to get show that it's right here disable you type print here see what happens ok what happened so she said that she thinks it's because of the input uh-huh doesn't it deleted it wasn't able to so what does input do you know i say implant come on input export nelo if i put input back entertainment come on let's just correct another why are you i have to restart kernel every time no actually i want to leave that you may be better if you put the laptop over there because it's kind of like in the middle of everything organized you see you see what happened sorry see what happens so like i just want them to mess with the codes right mm-hmm so we deleted the input and then the the what is your name disappeared in printing here is it means that it's loading it's running so leave me a message our policy is literally to hire as many ok what do you want the laptop to be order maybe if you move well you can get us here here here ok let me organize this because it's too messy you see i see right i don't know him really yeah really yeah are you sure do we have to set up so if it's if it shows like this it means that it's loading so it's still running yeah but actually i think you run the whole thing it's the start of the kernel yeah i mean it's kind of weird i don't know why restart and clear output wait kernel start period alright you know i think it's it's just sorry thank you for moving my mouse 4 isn't funny so so i think first we need you should explain to them what are the different colors and then this is important what does that what is this you know what this right yeah ok go ahead so they know before they even like start the code looking so significant lucky is sk and snk second man that's good go to school sticking around that's all are you waiting for three days what word do you need questions hashtag and so on so but it's not just question though if you put a hashtag what does that do what is it called there's an output start with but some command what does that what does come in do so and command is not ok yeah so i said command with command so does it affect the code alright so commands like commands is for you guys not for the computer it you use it to like say ok i wanna know what this line do right if you just put it like this and you're not used to coding it's hard for you to understand what it does right so one way to help you is to put a hashtag what the hashtag hashtag does is that you can type whatever and it won't it won't affect us so you can say ok this line does this it's for your own good like for your notes ok but if you get rid of the hashtag and type like this line does this this this this you run it the computer will read that but it doesn't understand right because it's not a command so it's gonna give you error so yeah i guess it's the command not not affect that i love coding the hashtag hashtag england kinda i suppose i eat love well yeah 35 and then she explained to you right what is what is the red what is that it's what what do you want the computer to do like this just to say ok so if you if if you take out the quote what do you think is gonna be so first of all let me just comment all of this out ok comment it out means the computer won't read it won't care right because command is for you so if i commend this out so it doesn't run the whole thing how do i command this edit so if you want to commend the whole block so this hashtag only come in one one line ok you remember what is the code to commend the whole block it was choice ok and i want to maximize are you sure so if you put three quote it gonna come in the whole thing see now it's all red ok so then the computer only read this line the rest it doesn't care because those are comments ok physical it's pretty good ok yeah we only want to see what this does we don't care about the rest yet have a look a restaurant so then now you say that this one is to tell the computer what it what to do right what to say ok so if i take the poll out wait let's run this real quick go ahead and run it ok so",
      "display": "So that one is also a computer. So is Raspberry Python maintenance on the computer. You like it. Is is. How do can you shut this down and then give her the the Raspberry Pi so she can just see what it is? Yeah yeah, but you have to shut down the thing first and then you can. What? Here, how about you sit where should you sit so that you all can? Yeah, you wanna sit. Speaker. Next please. Right? Yeah? And then just unplug it everything and then explain to her what that is the Raspberry Pi. Hello. I see you know this right? Yeah you do you good. OK, so go ahead. She only speaks Spanish. I don't know how to say this stuff in Spanish, no? Can he say something in English and can you translate for him great? So what is that whole thing? The whole thing is. So. Raspberry. Good luck. So no worries. So this part is. Connect the keyboard the mouse. Even the monitor. Yeah. It's a mask and keyboard. Control. No, you don't have any. I mean the laptop because it loads really slow with this so but again, that was causing that. Now. Ohhh. Bound. Would you mind using the monitors? Yeah so connect. Connect this to the monitor. So it will show yeah, so it will show on the monitor. Yeah. And we do. OK. Is that a yes? Yes now. And then it's going OK. These are all right. That's why I don't judge. Can you explain to her what you just did? Champions good. Let me connect. Master so I mean. That's better God. Champions. Granny yeah yeah OK champion yeah. Solar. OK. Nothing. OK. I. So you want. Harry. Tomorrow, yeah. All your names start with J. OK, So what are we doing so? I'm not scared so. And significant. Better. No serial port. OK. Already done so. Do you understand her? 100%. Wait wait wait. OK. OK. So Anna, we're gonna. So OK. Escape. It is. In the governor's office. And how do we show? Those codes. , they say. We cannot stop. Hey. Princess OK. So I give you Hope Quest number. You're asking me to number, so I got a keyboard. Yes, give me the number. Now. It's because we didn't connect the. Flash. Yeah. Enter. Deeper. And there is an OK. Give camera. Cortana. 11 center multiplication yeah. Those. They they're. So the first line is wow. So they show you. So yeah. Get a thermometer. Or there are. OK, now let me know. Hello. Can you see? Question. Says ABC what are these? Play the game. We're already playing you already playing it, but you know what's going on inside. Hello. Practically, what's going on inside is that, like here, are all the codes that are starting the game, so everything that is right here is like starting the game. So like you could see right here, it has translated to like you. So like we could also change it. So let me ask you something. We're getting. So what does this mean? The first line it's asking for? You're asking for your name. It says what is your name, right? So when we run this? OK OK, can you say what is your name Joe Johanna? So where did that come from? Though it came from the first quarter. Remember what we actually know? Alright, so anyway. So we're running this anymore. Where did where did they get this? They got it. When did she type it in? Thanks. It was before you guys did that before. Brothers and so. I'm going to restart the kernel and it's still saving the. 1. Alright, so what's happening is say, what is your name and then it gives you the box, right? Yeah, so why do you think it gives you the box of to type? Where in the code do you think it gives you the box to type, you know? OK, well you haven't watched it. Can you use the mouse look at the postal number? This whole thing is the code. This whole thing make this whole thing works. OK so go up all the way. That you compose as a process. So it's looking that look. No. So the first of all it print out. What is your name right? So where does that come from? Where do you think which line makes it print out the word? What is your name? Burnt uh which line? So you know this. What number what? There's a line number? Name print out. What do you think that make it so? Because the box let you type right now when you say Hola. And I love you, Chris. Tomato. , empty. You see it. You see it OK, let you take this one that you said that so the Hindu. The comment is still on the line 1 less. Where do you think that it let you put the type in so? Yes, thank you. Offline but what word let you type? OK, thank you. I would just say if you delete this input type key you see what happened. Infant is quite famous, but. I think. What did she say? OK so anyway so. Pull out with this and get better. Yes. OK, So what happened? So he don't have a phone, she's OK, but she only speaks in Spanish and he's yeah. Alright, so can you ask them? Can you ask them? See he deleted the word input OK and now he run it. And then nothing printed. I need that and also. Guitar. He also runs NASA. Allow you to type anything right? But why didn't it print out? What is your name? Could I have a command? If you want to know input, let you type right, you get it out so you don't. It doesn't type anymore, but. Why doesn't it print? Thank you, you're right. You're on the right track. It's missing a command. What command? If you want something. The one that she. Color. They were. So I'll come in and input. Print and input. These are right, So what do you think you need to to just show you what to get? Show that. It's right here. Disable. You type print here, see what happens. OK, what happened? So she said that she thinks it's because of the input uh-huh doesn't it deleted? It wasn't able to. So what does input do, you know? I say implant. Come on input export Nelo. If I put input back. Entertainment. Come on, let's just. Correct? Another why are you? I have to restart kernel every time. No, actually I want to leave that you may be better if you put the laptop over there because it's kind of like in the middle of everything organized. You see, you see what happened, sorry. See what happens. So like I just want them to mess with the codes right Mm-hmm so we deleted the input and then the the. What is your name disappeared in printing here? Is it means that it's loading it's running so leave me a message. Our policy is literally to hire as many. OK, what do you want the laptop to be order maybe? If you move. Well, you can get us here, here, here. OK, let me organize this because it's too messy. You see, I see right. I don't know him. Really, yeah really. Yeah Are you sure? Do we have to set up? So if it's if it shows like this, it means that it's loading, so it's still running. Yeah, but actually I think you run the whole thing. It's the start of the kernel. Yeah, I mean, it's kind of weird. I don't know why restart and clear output wait. Kernel start. Alright, you know, I think it's. It's just. Sorry, thank you for moving my mouse. 4 isn't funny. So. So I think first we need. You should explain to them what are the different colors and then this is important. What does that? What is this? You know what? This right? Yeah, OK, go ahead so they know before they even like start the code. Looking. So significant. Lucky is SK and. SNK, second. Man, that's good. Go to school. Sticking around. That's all. Are you waiting for three days? What word do you need? Questions. Hashtag and so on. So, but it's not just question though. If you put a hashtag, what does that do? What is it called? There's an output. Start with. But some command what does that? What does come in do so and command is not OK. Yeah, so I said command with command. So does it affect the code? Alright, so commands like commands is for you guys, not for the computer it you use it to like say OK I wanna know what this line do right? If you just put it like this and you're not used to coding, it's hard for you to understand what it does right? So one way to help you is to put a hashtag what the hashtag hashtag does is that you can type whatever and it won't. It won't affect us. So you can say OK, this line does this. It's for your own good. Like for your notes, OK, but if you get rid of the hashtag and type like this line does this this this this you run it, the computer will read that, but it doesn't understand right? Because it's not a command, so it's gonna give you error. So yeah, I guess it's the command not not affect that I love. Coding. The hashtag. Hashtag England kinda? I suppose I eat. Love. Well, yeah. 35 and then she explained to you, right, what is what is the red? What is that it's? What? What do you want the computer to do like this? Just to say. OK, so if you if if you take out the quote, what do you think is gonna be? So first of all let me just comment all of this out. OK comment it out means the computer won't read it won't care right? Because command is for you. So if I commend this out so it doesn't run the whole thing, how do I command this? Edit. So if you want to commend the whole block so this hashtag only come in one one line, OK, you remember what is the code to commend the whole block? It was. Choice. OK, and I want to maximize. Are you sure? So if you put three quote, it gonna come in the whole thing. See now it's all red. OK so then the computer only read this line, the rest it doesn't care because those are comments OK? Physical. It's pretty good. OK, yeah. We only want to see what this does. We don't care about the rest yet. Have a look. A restaurant. So then now you say that this one is to tell the computer what it what to do, right? What to say? OK, so if I take the poll out, wait, let's run this real quick, go ahead and run it. OK, so."

OK, I mean he said that it's not recording the whole thing. Microphone. What's the time? Right? Let me get your what you guys already have. What's the saddest coming? What color do you think of when you're sad? Hello. Blue in our class like what toes are like. Used to emphasize like sadness or. Melancholy, hilly Blues clues and grace. Yeah. Lesson. Do you know why? I'd like to. That one. Right? The voice. See. We can start coding. After you die. Was the father. Associated every 10 seconds. It just. We had four. Do you know how to control? So every 5 seconds. After you type. After you've finished typing something so just, that's like now my finger just do it automatically. But what this does? The whole grain, and then you want to paint the particular grids here, right? So for the particular number of rows and columns in this one. Yeah. Right? What about you? So much. What is the 1st? Now you should fill the frame zero with your characters. From here. This guy's background is where the for the whole rows and columns we filled in like cooking and then we copied that back background to the friendship. So your frame 0. The whole thing is light Gray. Now everything and then you want to go on top and you're going to draw either the dog dog one dog, two in the calendar. You can just create the characters now. So this one I image fill should change this to frame 0. You need to know where your dog is, so let me just give you. Yeah. This is for four hours purposes. So I always put comments and know what I'm making so it's OK. You too. If I want to make sure. This one was the two and four. That means all of the work. Column and the yeah you just need to touch it. Start rolling and if I only want this one. Ohhh. What is the? What is on Skype? Roy. We're moving. Are you? Yeah. Since I only want to draw this road right, there's only one road, right? Start one row one. OK, we need Spanish. You want. What about the column? What column do I start? What color will it? Yeah. What is the color? No, wait. I'm writing. So you need to go back and see. Use the English. And just focus. And focus on the code. Then town. Anyway. Go over there. Since we need one line to line 346786 times. Yeah, and then. You should know which part. Just put them in. What column do you start? Simulation. Video. Simulation. So we finished off. Did you say please? It's wonderful. So you put comments. So we'll finish this one. Now you're going. How many? Oh my God. Don't talk to me. 13, 13, are you?
