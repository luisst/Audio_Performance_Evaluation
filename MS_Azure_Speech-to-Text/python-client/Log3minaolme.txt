      "display": "Yeah, so that's why. And those are the binary numbers. I think if you think OK, that's cool. That's nice. So anything we want to tell you more about what you've learned in math. In math at school we are we're going through where? Find the the. Uhm? The tax of a number 0. Do you have you found any relationships between what you're learning here and what you're learning at school? I have found some 'cause we've learned about the power of two at school, so I'm kind of familiar with them. And then for the. For the table, it also has to two by a power of two. Umm, so when you were learning about exponentially at school, you were familiar with it? Yeah, cool. What grade are you in? I'm in 6th grade, 6th grade. OK, nice, but now let's go to programming. So if we think about programming before and after, where were you before? How much you knew how much field where you are after? I used to know nothing about programming. OK so you would 'cause I was like I never got a chance to program anything and then I saw they allow me. Had a good programming and they had a bus so we decided I decided it. Enter and especially there's a bus 'cause my mom is busy and she can't really pick me up. And you know, do you think that the bus was really helpful for you to be able to come? The best I would have been to the element right? Because you know there's no person who could actually take you back to home. Mom, my people, but other times this she's busy, right? It's very hard, so I'm glad that there is a bus, right? Cool so after being in all my work, do you think you will place yourself in programming learning what? For programming five OK. So why do you think you're like a rough 5 now? Well 'cause? I kind of know the programming, but sometimes I have a little trouble me like on the part where we were learning like we were making the videos. How you go like. The new color in the box. Sometimes I get a little confused by that. Oh, sometimes I just need someone to help me out. Get it, you get it. Rows and columns. Their their roles and the roles on their columns, right? Yeah, how they help you program things or create things that where are you creating? Nope. Uh, we working 'cause Michaels he wanted pirates and we wanted cookies so we had to decide away where it was both. So having a pair with a puppy. Puppy pirate Oh, that's cool.
